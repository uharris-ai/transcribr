PARTICIPANT 1 TRANSCRIPTS 

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.009
Unice Harris: Good morning. Can you hear me?
21
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:58.890
PARTICIPANT 1 Good morning. Yes, I can thank you so much for joining your participation is invaluable to my study.
22
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.760
Unice Harris: How's everything going?
23
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.780
PARTICIPANT 1It's it's been good, that

24
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.579
PARTICIPANT 1kind  of surprised of our local. Yeah. My chapter.

25
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:24.510
PARTICIPANT 1hope they're doing. Okay. I sent them some talks and stuff I could do this year, but haven't really heard back. business was going good this year.

26
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:36.490
Unice Harris: Yeah, I didn't know you were doing a PhD program. Oh, yeah, I'm doing a a Dba actually doctorate in business administration. And once we are.

27
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:45.960
Unice Harris: once we are done with the questions. I'll talk to you about Pmi. The local chapter.

28
00:13:46.200 --> 00:14:10.460
Unice Harris:  it! It's it's very interesting. So I'll I'll go ahead and get started. Let me just start with this question. Please confirm with the yes or no answer that you and I are not personal best friends or personal acquaintances. We're not hanging out at each other's houses and things of that nature. So just a yes or no answer there.

29
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.010
PARTICIPANT 1Yes.

30
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.919
Unice Harris: perfect. Thank you, I know.

31
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.150
Thank you.

32
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:29.630
Unice Harris: So let's go ahead and get started. The first question. And again I am doing my study on

33
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:42.950
the BENEFITS. Of incorporating CHANGE MANAGEMENT into DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs. Again, been around the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION landscape for about 20 years now.

34
00:14:42.950 --> 00:15:10.710
Unice Harris: Before they even started calling it DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. So question number one during the initiation or other phase or start of the PROJECT, can you share a time when you communicated the PURPOSE of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION, and how it would enhance or help the ORGANIZATION. So share a time where you were doing maybe

35
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:17.540
Unice Harris: a gaming TRANSFORMATION or other TRANSFORMATION. And you communicated

36
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:26.920
Unice Harris: the PURPOSE of that to the ORGANIZATION or to the TEAM that you were working with.

37
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.380
PARTICIPANT 1Sure.

38
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:41.300
PARTICIPANT 1so I guess one example, I was working on a initiative to get PEOPLE virtual desktops or CLOUD based workspaces.

39
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.530
PARTICIPANT 1And

40
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.600
PARTICIPANT 1for the PROJECT. So this was relatively NEW, and and prior to that

41
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:55.899
PARTICIPANT 1 you know, folks were spread out across the ORGANIZATIONs networks or across the country.

42
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.720
PARTICIPANT 1And like, I remember, I heard a story

43
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.030
PARTICIPANT 1that

44
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:11.380
PARTICIPANT 1that someone would like their computer would take 30 min to start up so they'd go and make coffee and do all this other stuff. and

45
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:23.750
PARTICIPANT 1I really had to drill in with the IT folks to be clear on the business BENEFITS of of this, because we got PEOPLE converted over. They started to see that

46
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:35.100
PARTICIPANT 1that they could have greater efficiency. And then we also had a SURVEY where we were tracking what PEOPLE said PEOPLE would share comments with me. We tried to address them

47
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.430
PARTICIPANT 1 so I think, showing the BENEFITS

48
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:51.519
PARTICIPANT 1in that instance. And I think in some of the other stuff I've done. I think it's more than just at the beginning. It's It's reminding them, because because I think sometimes

49
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.140
PARTICIPANT 1we can all get stuck in.

50
00:16:54.590 --> 00:17:00.250
PARTICIPANT 1Our world went to work, and we might forget the PURPOSE of of a PROJECT or a

51
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.369
PARTICIPANT 1DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. So I think reminding them is helpful.

52
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.770
PARTICIPANT 1Did did that answer that? Thank you for that?

53
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.089
Unice Harris: Yep, it did.

54
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:23.600
Unice Harris: How did you communicate it? Was it like a corporate wide EMAIL, or a MEETING, or other sharepoint? Or how did you communicate those BENEFITS?

55
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:32.640
PARTICIPANT 1I think it was a mix of those II think. We, we definitely used ORGANIZATION wide EMAILS.

56
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.430
PARTICIPANT 1We had some live TRAINING sessions where PEOPLE could ask questions.

57
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:48.780
PARTICIPANT 1We had a SURVEY that we would track. So as PEOPLE got convert over to the NEW CLOUD based workspace that

58
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.220
PARTICIPANT 1you know, we would look and see

59
00:17:51.230 --> 00:18:00.230
PARTICIPANT 1about the usability of it like if if it was sticky or not, and then what comments PEOPLE had, and and at the end we had a

60
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.380
PARTICIPANT 1kind of a closing SURVEY, where we threw on some other questions

61
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.750
PARTICIPANT 1and the insights we got is not only interesting

62
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.650
PARTICIPANT 1for that initiative, but also for

63
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:18.030
PARTICIPANT 1other stuff to keep in mind regarding virtual workspaces.

64
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:28.509
Unice Harris: Okay? So when you communicated this, do you feel like it helped

65
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:38.630
Unice Harris: minimize confusion about the BENEFITS of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT and

66
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.960
PARTICIPANT 1hmm!

67
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:53.250
PARTICIPANT 1BENEFITS of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. Did you have another part to that question?

68
00:18:54.070 --> 00:19:06.129
Unice Harris: Yep, let me So when you communicated the BENEFITS of  how the SYSTEM would

69
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:18.010
Unice Harris: impact them when you communicated the BENEFITS of the virtual desktop. Do you feel like it? Minimize confusion about the PURPOSE of the PROJECT.

70
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.700
PARTICIPANT 1My communicator.

71
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.599
Unice Harris: when you did the

72
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:41.399
Unice Harris: when you did the ORGANIZATION-wide, EMAIL or the ORGANIZATION wide MEETING and talk to them about the BENEFITS of the desktop rollout PROJECT that you were implemented.

73
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:48.079
Unice Harris: Did it seem to minimize confusion amongst the PEOPLE that are go? We're going to use it.

74
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.990
PARTICIPANT 1Hmm!

75
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.109
I think in some ways it did. But I think the other challenge, too, is that

76
00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:05.629
PARTICIPANT 1when you think about  So so there's this book that I read about. It's called The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and

77
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:13.719
PARTICIPANT 1in the book the author argues that we all have. He calls it like a like a whirlwind. So it's like our day to day stuff.

78
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:24.769
PARTICIPANT 1And then there's stuff outside of that. We have to do so kind of similar in a ORGANIZATION. You've got your day to day stuff, and then your PROJECT stuff. And

79
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:31.849
PARTICIPANT 1I think that the reason why we did we tried to communicate consistently

80
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.049
PARTICIPANT 1is because I think PEOPLE PEOPLE forget.

81
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.000
PARTICIPANT 1or if they're on vacation, they might not understand.

82
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:46.310
PARTICIPANT 1And then you might have some PEOPLE that are resistant to CHANGE. And so.

83
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:56.119
PARTICIPANT 1 you know, helping them become a part of that CHANGE. So so pairing them up with you know PEOPLE to SUPPORT them

84
00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:08.940
PARTICIPANT 1or possibly contacting their supervisors. I mean that one's not obviously not an ideal way to start, but if it would get that bad? So I I'd say

85
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.320
PARTICIPANT 1having frequent COMMUNICATION, but then also reminding them.

86
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.539
Unice Harris: I think it also helps them remember

87
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:27.909
PARTICIPANT 1the overall end goal. So so why, we're doing the PROJECT in the first place. So that way in the middle. you know, one of the sponsors wouldn't try to pull the plug

88
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.560
PARTICIPANT 1we were doing this CHANGE.

89
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.330
Unice Harris: Okay.

90
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.810
Unice Harris: thank you for that.

91
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:45.459
Unice Harris:  can you share a time? Can you also share a time where you did not communicate the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION or the PURPOSE

92
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.030
Unice Harris: just of the PROJECT.

93
00:21:49.600 --> 00:22:07.260
Unice Harris: And maybe you don't have a time. Yeah, some. Some. In in many cases. I know for me. When I start a PROJECT I'm pulling everybody together, and I'm communicating. This is why we're doing the PROJECT. This is the PURPOSE of it.

94
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:31.010
But not everybody does it that way. So is there a time where you didn't share the PURPOSE of the PROJECT, and it caused a little bit of confusion or chaos, and if you always do that, you know, you can just kind of say, no, there's never been a time. I always let PEOPLE know what's you know the PURPOSE of the PROJECT

95
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.130
PARTICIPANT 1PURPOSE?

96
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.529
PARTICIPANT 1That's a good question. I would say that

97
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:47.130
PARTICIPANT 1that that I think it's always important to remember the PURPOSE, and I can't really think of a

98
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:53.109
PARTICIPANT 1PROJECT where I didn't share that, I would say for some of the PROJECT work I inherited

99
00:22:53.150 --> 00:23:04.070
PARTICIPANT 1when I had associates leave there was one where I came in. I think it was like 40% complete. And II just remember

100
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.660
PARTICIPANT 1it. It was such. It was such a weird PROJECT, because,

101
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.340
PARTICIPANT 1the group that wanted it done.

102
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:19.090
PARTICIPANT 1They claimed it was their number one priority, but it really didn't feel like it. And

103
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.489
probably should have done more to

104
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.360
PARTICIPANT 1to drive it home about the BENEFITS and stuff and

105
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.510
PARTICIPANT 1ironically. So after I left. So

106
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:36.770
PARTICIPANT 1you know, they spent all this time behind schedule on the SYSTEM. They ended up not using it.

107
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.370
PARTICIPANT 1So so I think that's an example.

108
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:50.989
PARTICIPANT 1probably more with PROJECT Manager prior to me coming in that there was just confusion about the BENEFITS. And

109
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.230
remember

110
00:23:53.510 --> 00:24:00.410
PARTICIPANT 1some PEOPLE were upset about it. They they felt like that PROJECT shouldn't have taken as long as it did that it should have went faster.

111
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.939
So I guess that's an example. Where.

112
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:10.659
PARTICIPANT 1if if the BENEFITS have been clearer. if there had been more urgency, it probably could have been done a lot faster.

113
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.940
Unice Harris: I get that I definitely get that? Okay.

114
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.509
perfect.

115
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.959
Unice Harris:  question number 2,

116
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:38.790
Unice Harris: during the requirements or any other phase of the TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you informed cross functional TEAMS or the ORGANIZATION as a whole.

117
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:46.950
of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically, and how it would affect or impact or enhance

118
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:55.719
Unice Harris: how they do their work, and I think you touched on that. I think you already answered that to a certain degree. So that's saying,

119
00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:09.920
we're starting this PROJECT, let's say, in this area. But it's going to affect multiple different business areas or business units or DEPARTMENTs.

120
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.250
Unice Harris: and so if you could share.

121
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:18.240
Unice Harris: How you informed those different areas.

122
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.610
Unice Harris: how it would impact them and how it would enhance their work

123
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.010
Unice Harris: or how it would impact their work.

124
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:45.979
PARTICIPANT 1Okay? So I think there's a couple pieces today. I think the first part in terms of the ORGANIZATION as a whole.  you know, I think doing some kind of or at least having some idea of the the impact across different functional areas.

125
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.040
PARTICIPANT 1 you know, going back to finding CHAMPIONs.

126
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:58.840
PARTICIPANT 1EMAIL. So finding place to, you know, communicate multiple times. And then.

127
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:08.630
PARTICIPANT 1I think also to engage different COMMUNICATION styles. So we had reference articles which would be more for a

128
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.719
PARTICIPANT 1like a visual person.

129
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:18.020
PARTICIPANT 1or auditory. You know, we made videos for folks that prefer to cure stuff

130
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:24.900
PARTICIPANT 1is their main learning style. And then for folks that are more hands-on, we offered opportunities for TESTING

131
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.700
PARTICIPANT 1and early engagement with

132
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.090
PARTICIPANT 1the SYSTEM. I think at a DEPARTMENT level.

133
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:39.669
PARTICIPANT 1So being clear on the STAKEHOLDERS that are affected especially the ones that have the highest impact.

134
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.869
PARTICIPANT 1And being clear on

135
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:51.160
PARTICIPANT 1what they currently do. So the current state. But then what the future state would look like. So so explain the BENEFITS of that NEW SYSTEM, and then

136
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.009
PARTICIPANT 1helping guide them from the current state to the future state

137
00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:06.430
PARTICIPANT 1and helping them realize that they don't have to do it by themselves, that the ORGANIZATION's a TEAM and it shouldn't just be one functional area

138
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.159
PARTICIPANT 1 leading an initiative that

139
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.400
PARTICIPANT 1affects other areas or the ORGANIZATION as a whole.

140
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.420
And I think if the impact is big enough

141
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.540
PARTICIPANT 1on some of the large functional areas, then

142
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.439
PARTICIPANT 1and I think you've heard me talk about this. It might require a steering committee.

143
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:39.939
PARTICIPANT 1so group of executives or managers. That could be informed on what's happening. But then, also, if there's issues, you could bring it to them. So that way, you can get those resolved quickly

144
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:45.360
PARTICIPANT 1and not slow down a a DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION or initiative.

145
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.470
Unice Harris: Okay? And once you did that?

146
00:27:53.270 --> 00:28:09.750
Unice Harris: Did the ORGANIZATION seem to be receptive about the CHANGE, or hesitant about the CHANGE? And then after knowing how the CHANGE would enhance. How they work. Did they have a desire to be more involved?

147
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:20.519
PARTICIPANT 1So I think, after doing all that stuff, I think they were more receptive to the CHANGE. I think, regardless of

148
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:30.199
PARTICIPANT 1How much you plan. I always think of CHANGE in terms of the the curve from Rogers. So you've got the

149
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.880
PARTICIPANT 1you know, you have the folks that are like a couple of percent that are.

150
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:40.280
PARTICIPANT 1you know, the early adopters. Then you've got your early majority.

151
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:53.959
PARTICIPANT 1And your CHANGE really doesn't stick until you get to that middle majority. So so on on PROJECTs. I'm always thinking, how do we get more PEOPLE toward that middle majority, faster in in a way that makes sense.

152
00:28:54.010 --> 00:29:05.240
PARTICIPANT 1For the functional areas. II think working with them pretty closely, especially as you get close to deployment and post deployment, I think that that helps

153
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:14.100
PARTICIPANT 1address concerns also having them involved in TESTING and giving feedback and and doing that in a

154
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:28.149
PARTICIPANT 1environment where they can feel heard. Cause. I think some of the times I think some of the fear PEOPLE have with CHANGES that you know their voice will get drowned out, or they they won't feel heard.

155
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:34.809
PARTICIPANT 1 Even if their ideas are not adopted as long as they feel like someone listened to them.

156
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:47.449
PARTICIPANT 1They'll be more open to the CHANGE, and I think from a steering committee level. It's just making sure the managers. The executives are sponsors

157
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.059
PARTICIPANT 1 that they're aware of what's coming, what's going on?

158
00:29:51.080 --> 00:30:01.990
PARTICIPANT 1And they have the knowledge to be able to make decisions that affect. You know the whole ORGANIZATION with regards to that DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.

159
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.440
Unice Harris: Got it?

160
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:16.200
Unice Harris: And once you implemented your DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, did the PROJECT eventually increase revenue

161
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.910
PARTICIPANT 1to increase revenue.

162
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:35.300
Unice Harris: And maybe that wasn't the PURPOSE of the PROJECT. I mean, some DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs just upgrade SYSTEMS. They don't have the ultimate end goal of increasing revenue. So

163
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.640
PARTICIPANT 1hmm

164
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:47.139
PARTICIPANT 1I think for some of the work I did it. It did increase REVENUEor at least open up NEW business opportunities, and then.

165
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:53.259
PARTICIPANT 1I think, for other PROJECTs. So so I mentioned the the virtual desktops.

166
00:30:53.470 --> 00:31:04.699
PARTICIPANT 1 I still think there's a dollar value on efficiency gained or cost savings. So II do think there was a BENEFIT. It was just more

167
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.960
PARTICIPANT 1internally focused versus external.

168
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.420
Unice Harris: Okay.

169
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.160
Unice Harris: thank you for that.

170
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.970
Unice Harris: Alright. Let's get down to question number 3.

171
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:47.180
Unice Harris: So in the design phase or any other phase before development. The DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION life cycle, can you share how you provide us? Some kind of TRAINING relative to the PROCESS TECHNOLOGY or NEW TRANSFORMATION initiative.

172
00:31:47.230 --> 00:32:04.660
Unice Harris: and I say, in design phase, or any other phase. How did you go about providing TRAINING for the NEW initiative. And then, if you can also share a time where you didn't provide any TRAINING.

173
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:15.309
Unice Harris: and I think you really already covered that in a previous question, I think you had already talked about that but now we're here, so

174
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.179
PARTICIPANT 1no that's fine

175
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:31.240
PARTICIPANT 1I think the TRAINING piece is important, because it goes back to the learning styles but giving PEOPLE sense of ownership, so showing them that

176
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:41.499
PARTICIPANT 1that. They don't have to do this CHANGE by themselves that they  you know, that's okay for them to make

177
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.710
PARTICIPANT 1some mistakes before something goes live. I'm

178
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:59.879
PARTICIPANT 1so II think, a mix of stuff. So so doing. So like, we're we're on a recording right now. You know, recording TRAINING sessions making those accessible

179
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.820
PARTICIPANT 1SUPPORT articles.

180
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:06.079
PARTICIPANT 1 you know, finding a group of early adopters

181
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:18.129
PARTICIPANT 1finding CHAMPIONs within different functional areas. So they can. you know, instead of someone coming to me as the PROJECT manager that could go to someone

182
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.319
PARTICIPANT 1closer to them or colleague, they might know

183
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.299
PARTICIPANT 1but but I think to when doing

184
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.520
PARTICIPANT 1TEAM MEETINGS or in between TEAM MEETINGS just being open to

185
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:44.959
PARTICIPANT 1listening to what PEOPLE have to say. even if it's not what you want to hear. I've I've had times where PEOPLE have said bad stuff about an initiative and

186
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.350
PARTICIPANT 1you have. You have to show empathy and understanding

187
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:54.539
PARTICIPANT 1and do what you can to help them, but also recognize that there's limits that

188
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:58.210
PARTICIPANT 1we don't have unlimited budget and time

189
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:04.869
PARTICIPANT 1 And to some extent I think that's okay. Cause when you're putting stuff out there, it doesn't

190
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:14.320
PARTICIPANT 1have to be totally perfect. So I think, making sure when you're doing TRAINING. you know, recognizing that.

191
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:21.860
PARTICIPANT 1that some of this stuff will be iterative. You'll put something out there. And then there might be another phase or update

192
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:33.300
PARTICIPANT 1and you know, with that, making sure you update materials. So that way, if you bring on NEW folks or PEOPLE near refresher, it's it's as current as it can be.

193
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:43.480
PARTICIPANT 1 and I think that's where where I see ORGANIZATIONs fall down is the knowledge, transfer and the knowledge acquisition.

194
00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:52.449
PARTICIPANT 1 II think for some of the initiatives, I've seen where they've been less SUCCESSFUL. They haven't been.

195
00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.450
PARTICIPANT 1you know, these are initiatives. I've heard about that haven't been managed by me.

196
00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:13.099
PARTICIPANT 1Ii think that's one of the reasons why they fail is because  they're so focused on. you know, gain the TECHNOLOGY right and improving a PROCESS that they forget about the PEOPLE that will

197
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.809
PARTICIPANT 1be using a SYSTEM and ultimately have to to live with it in the long term

198
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.980
Unice Harris: that makes perfect sense.

199
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.569
Unice Harris: is there a time? Where or can you share a time where you

200
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:41.029
Unice Harris: didn't provide TRAINING? Is there an implementation somewhere in your years of experience, where you guys just kinda through the SYSTEM out there?

201
00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:49.850
Unice Harris: implemented the SYSTEM and didn't provide the TRAINING. And how did that impact?  the implementation?

202
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.730
PARTICIPANT 1Hmm! That's another good question.

203
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:02.279
PARTICIPANT 1 this might sound like a strange answer. But when I was working on

204
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.990
PARTICIPANT 1 introducing the the course with Minecraft.

205
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:13.790
PARTICIPANT 1and so we'd engage the It DEPARTMENT. We got funding and approval to do it.

206
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:26.689
PARTICIPANT 1 And and you know II put this plan together, and I said, Let's do TESTING and this and that  while we we didn't hear back from that group and

207
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:38.819
PARTICIPANT 1you know. It came down closer to to the go live date and  we had issues because we didn't take the time to do TESTING

208
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:50.379
PARTICIPANT 1you know. Luckily we're able to to mitigate that pretty quickly. I had a workaround, but you know, if I hadn't jumped in

209
00:36:50.400 --> 00:37:00.699
PARTICIPANT 1then You know that initiative might have failed. So so I think. And you know, the the reason why that happened was because the

210
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:09.270
PARTICIPANT 1the SYSTEM we were using, we thought it could be used in a certain way, and it turned out it couldn't and and we didn't know

211
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:15.530
PARTICIPANT 1because we we hadn't done that that research ahead of time.

212
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:23.380
PARTICIPANT 1And another part is something NEW. So when you're working on something innovative, or if you, you're like one of the first adopters.

213
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:28.670
PARTICIPANT 1I think, going along with that that CHANGE MAANAGEMENT curve I mentioned.

214
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.549
PARTICIPANT 1 so in a in a PROJECT, you can have those early adopters.

215
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:45.039
PARTICIPANT 1They'll find some of those challenges. Well, if you're an ORGANIZATION and you're one of the first adopters of a SYSTEM like Work Day, for instance.

216
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.350
PARTICIPANT 1you know, you'll be in that early Adopter phase, too. So finding issues and stuff that

217
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:58.500
PARTICIPANT 1 you know the vendor or ORGANIZATION providing that product or service that that they hadn't realized either.

218
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.560
PARTICIPANT 1Did did that answer their question?

219
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.340
Unice Harris: Yep.

220
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:17.040
Unice Harris: that answered it perfectly. Let's see, let's go down to question number 4,

221
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:43.319
Unice Harris: and I think you just answered this one. In the TESTING phase of the TRANSFORMATION. Can you share a time where you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY PROCESS? Maybe a user acceptance test or a SYSTEMS integration test and to confirm that it worked the way that it should.

222
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:52.000
PARTICIPANT 1I've actually done that a lot. I've had. PEOPLE say, I'm really good at TESTING, because

223
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.850
cause I make sure it's urgent. So you know, setting that that schedule

224
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.010
PARTICIPANT 1 as time went on, for some of these SYSTEMS

225
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.930
PARTICIPANT 1I would be involved in in some maintenance updates. And

226
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.650
PARTICIPANT 1we develop TESTING plans. So we ask PEOPLE, you know, what are

227
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.099
PARTICIPANT 1common functions that you use, and then we document that in an excel sheet.

228
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.549
PARTICIPANT 1and then I could send it to them. I could say, You know, here's a TESTING plan. Here's the the areas you've mentioned before.

229
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:31.639
PARTICIPANT 1 if they had NEW areas they could throw it in there. But I think doing that. And then

230
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:44.160
PARTICIPANT 1you know, giving PEOPLE clear expectations. Communicating across the ORGANIZATION. Hey, this update or CHANGE is coming. SYSTEMS gonna be down, you know, for ABC,

231
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:55.399
PARTICIPANT 1on this day from this time to that time. Also having PEOPLE there to test when you go live. So having folks test on the weekend.

232
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.969
PARTICIPANT 1Now what I really would have loved. And I'm hoping NEWer SYSTEMS have this

233
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:04.430
PARTICIPANT 1 is having automated TESTING

234
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.940
PARTICIPANT 1so where you could have

235
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.899
PARTICIPANT 1like a a I or something, go in and

236
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:19.100
PARTICIPANT 1and help with TESTING. Now I don't think it'll replace PEOPLE.  maybe in the distant future it could

237
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:31.559
PARTICIPANT 1but for for the SYSTEMS I was working on. They were very dated. And so so you couldn't do You know, you couldn't use automated tools for TESTING

238
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:44.319
PARTICIPANT 1 And then, you know, some post deployment SUPPORT. So I think, you know, recognizing there was a cycle for TESTING that you didn't just test and then be done and get ready to deploy

239
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:50.479
PARTICIPANT 1but really using that feedback, or at least the validating that the SYSTEM worked.

240
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.429
PARTICIPANT 1That that was just as important as the PROCESS of doing the TESTING itself.

241
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.700
Unice Harris: Was there a time that you didn't do TESTING? And how? How different was that?

242
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:34.600
PARTICIPANT 1Hmm. Well, I think the example I mentioned earlier about about Minecraft. We had gotten surprised. And it's it's kind of ironic. We actually discovered a product flaw.

243
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.370
PARTICIPANT 1 that

244
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:50.609
PARTICIPANT 1that when Microsoft designed the education edition of the game, they didn't imagine PEOPLE would be playing it online. They imagined it in a classroom where you have computers on a land network all connected.

245
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:55.780
PARTICIPANT 1So I think sometimes when you do TESTING. you discover

246
00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:09.220
PARTICIPANT 1flaws in a product or service, and I think it's important to notify the vendor about that. So so do like a corrective action. Request, or at least make them aware.

247
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.260
PARTICIPANT 1so they can try to try to improve that

248
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.810
PARTICIPANT 1I'm

249
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:23.250
PARTICIPANT 1there. I've been pretty good about TESTING on the stuff II try to to do. But

250
00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.959
PARTICIPANT 1There are horror stories I've heard where where SYSTEMS have been thrown out there.

251
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.270
From lack of TESTING.

252
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:38.219
PARTICIPANT 1And you know, I think it can be costly. I mean, imagine doing all this work on something, and then PEOPLE don't use it.

253
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.530
PARTICIPANT 1It's a

254
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:49.310
PARTICIPANT 1it's a waste of time. And the other part, too, is that you? You know you don't get that time and money back. That's a sunk cost. You can't recover.

255
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.720
PARTICIPANT 1 II think.

256
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.550
PARTICIPANT 1you know, I think some of this also ties into innovation. So

257
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:04.139
PARTICIPANT 1with the Minecraft class and program, I, I've worked on for several years.

258
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:08.770
PARTICIPANT 1It was part of a initiative to innovate

259
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.570
PARTICIPANT 1and different aspects of of education or courses.

260
00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:20.490
PARTICIPANT 1And I think the the problem with the program is that it encouraged PEOPLE to pursue all these ideas.

261
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:32.169
PARTICIPANT 1But then, once PEOPLE did their pilot, there was no follow up. So you know, recognizing with with CHANGE and DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs that

262
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.430
PARTICIPANT 1in some ways I almost think of it kinda like a flower like you know you

263
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.589
PARTICIPANT 1you you know you plant the seed, you let it grow, you SUPPORT it.

264
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:53.899
PARTICIPANT 1but then you have to keep letting it grow and keep SUPPORTing it. So recognizing that that sometimes it's more than just a one time investment that it could be recurring.

265
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.379
PARTICIPANT 1 and you know, I saw

266
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.559
PARTICIPANT 1some really innovative stuff that never got SUPPORTed.

267
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.660
PARTICIPANT 1And it basically became like a bridge to nowhere.

268
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:15.719
PARTICIPANT 1So no clear prioritization. And I think that that they lost out on some of the opportunities and REVENUEthey could have made from those

269
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.330
Unice Harris: Umhm. Okay.

270
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:43.279
Unice Harris: I think you just answered this next question, and I'm gonna ask it for the PURPOSE of asking it. And if you wanna add something more to it. I think the planning this lead and letting the flower grow is the perfect response to this question. After rolling out into production, how were

271
00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:54.170
Unice Harris: users, employees, and STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback relative to what worked in production and what seemed not to work so smoothly.

272
00:44:55.010 --> 00:45:05.689
PARTICIPANT 1Well, I think I think a mix of stuff. So doing. SURVEYs. you know, making sure. So in the context of it, like the

273
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:10.100
PARTICIPANT 1SUPPORT staff, or where the CHANGES coming.

274
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:23.930
PARTICIPANT 1You know, having those CHAMPIONs and those resources. Doing a you know, having a a post deployment SUPPORT period for for a while for a couple of weeks, maybe a month.

275
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.920
PARTICIPANT 1Could be more if it's a bigger initiative. But

276
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.300
PARTICIPANT 1Recognizing that when you deploy something that that's not the end.

277
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.680
PARTICIPANT 1That's just the end of

278
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:43.609
PARTICIPANT 1you know the, you know, spending months of requirements gathering, building something or finding a vendor

279
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:57.709
PARTICIPANT 1but that requires SUPPORT. And then in your PROJECT closing you know, clarifying. You know those roles and responsibilities going forward so that way the PROJECT manager can step out of that

280
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:02.820
PARTICIPANT 1and go on to something else. And then that NEW SYSTEM.

281
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.360
PARTICIPANT 1eventually becomes just kind of normalized.

282
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.620
PARTICIPANT 1Did did that top?

283
00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.460
Unice Harris: Okay.

284
00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.420
Unice Harris: let's see, question number 6,

285
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:34.290
Unice Harris:  and I think you

286
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:49.429
Unice Harris: talked about this as well. But I have to ask the questions as we progress through them, and if you could. If you don't mind repeating you just have some very interesting stories and experiences. Can you share

287
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:59.260
Unice Harris: an example of a DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION or TRANSFORMATION that went very well. Also one that didn't go very well. What did you do differently between the 2?

288
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:10.090
PARTICIPANT 1Okay. So I guess I'll start with the one that didn't go. Well. and I guess this is me kind of looking back at it now.

289
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:22.370
PARTICIPANT 1 so I was working on implementing a NEW and innovative AI SYSTEM. And I think initially, we were getting some traction.

290
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:33.659
PARTICIPANT 1We had a lot of interest. We had. We. you know our user base grew very quickly, but the problem we had was that it was not sticky enough.

291
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:41.620
PARTICIPANT 1So it's like it'd be like, for instance, you have a application. There's 10,000 users, but

292
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:50.170
PARTICIPANT 1only a thousand PEOPLE are using it. and out of those 1,000 there may be using it once or twice, and then.

293
00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.690
PARTICIPANT 1you know, going on to something else.

294
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:58.530
PARTICIPANT 1 you know, there, there were challenges with ORGANIZATIONal commitment.

295
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:04.459
PARTICIPANT 1you know, we didn't have funding to SUPPORT a wide adoption.

296
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:09.949
PARTICIPANT 1The the initiative got d prioritized.

297
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:20.990
PARTICIPANT 1and I think there weren't enough resources to to SUPPORT it longer. Term I think you had some heroic efforts by folks including myself.

298
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:27.080
PARTICIPANT 1You know, looking at creating those opportunities to leverage. But

299
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:39.700
PARTICIPANT 1you know, it's like I was saying with the plant, you know you grow the plant, and then. if you don't SUPPORT it sadly, it dies off. And  I think that's what happened with that initiative.

300
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:49.910
PARTICIPANT 1But you know, I can look back like II did what I could. And I think, as individuals, we have to realize that that that's okay, that

301
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.920
PARTICIPANT 1you know, you can't always win. You can just do the best you can

302
00:48:55.970 --> 00:49:04.380
PARTICIPANT 1and try to build up the PEOPLE around you so they can be SUCCESSFUL in terms of an initiative that I think went really well.

303
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:10.929
PARTICIPANT 1 I led a implementation of a event MAANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

304
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.290
PARTICIPANT 1So prior to that SYSTEM.

305
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:22.220
PARTICIPANT 1We're using a older SYSTEM. And stuff was just really uncoordinated. You know, lack of COMMUNICATION or

306
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:27.540
PARTICIPANT 1or the right STAKEHOLDERS being involved for the right event. and

307
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:34.280
PARTICIPANT 1Initially, the schedule was aggressive to get the SYSTEM in, but we extended it a little bit.

308
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.709
To allow for

309
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.189
PARTICIPANT 1you know that TESTING phase, having a good deployment

310
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:55.209
PARTICIPANT 1post deployment SUPPORT and then making sure that we met all the STAKEHOLDER requirements. And I'm happy to say that that SYSTEM still being used today.

311
00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:59.349
PARTICIPANT 1and it resolved a lot of the issues that

312
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:07.840
PARTICIPANT 1there were before that was introduced. And I think what we did differently with that one. I think that

313
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:17.410
PARTICIPANT 1you know, we had good resourcing. There's a commitment to sustain that SYSTEM in the long term and

314
00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:25.319
PARTICIPANT 1you know, the TEAM was engaged. We had TESTING and and it was just a good SYSTEM. I think, that.

315
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:34.429
PARTICIPANT 1Now, I wasn't involved in the the vendor selection PROCESS. But I think that that went really well. And that's why it's still going today.

316
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:41.790
Unice Harris: Okay? And did that. So SYSTEM eventually increase revenue.

317
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.270
PARTICIPANT 1Hmm.

318
00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:59.680
PARTICIPANT 1well, so I think the example I gave you is more of an internal facing initiative. But II do think that there is a productivity gain

319
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:07.289
PARTICIPANT 1and an internal efficiency that I think translates back into cost savings.

320
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:15.560
PARTICIPANT 1 in terms of the labor cost. And you know, reducing their cost of failure.

321
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.240
Unice Harris: Okay.

322
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.759
Unice Harris: question. Number 7.

323
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:31.929
Unice Harris: Can you share any activity taken to create a DIGITAL mind set within the ORGANIZATION?

324
00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:36.340
Has it helped or hurt the willingness to CHANGE.

325
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.670
PARTICIPANT 1Hmm! Efforts.

326
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.649
PARTICIPANT 1Well, I think that

327
00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:51.290
PARTICIPANT 1having cross functional MEETINGS looking at CHANGE or or emerging initiatives

328
00:51:51.490 --> 00:52:00.080
PARTICIPANT 1something I did. I created a like a special interest group to look at. You know, articles or videos.

329
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.600
PARTICIPANT 1but then also bring PEOPLE together in a positive way.

330
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:18.849
PARTICIPANT 1 I think that that worked. But I think eventually, and you know, so keep in mind some of the stuff I'm talking about happened during the the pandemic. So when there's, you know, massive disruption

331
00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.880
PARTICIPANT 1there just wasn't a

332
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:28.700
PARTICIPANT 1commitment from others to sustain stuff. And you know, had to let some of that go, but

333
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:35.310
PARTICIPANT 1I think encouraging PEOPLE to experiment with NEW ideas.

334
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.429
PARTICIPANT 1You know, share, share their points of view.

335
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:50.629
PARTICIPANT 1I think in some ways in the ORGANIZATION. It's hard because the ORGANIZATIONs trying to balance you know the needs of MAANAGEMENT. So so having control.

336
00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:04.200
PARTICIPANT 1But then, you know, giving PEOPLE some ownership in encouraging them to be entrepreneurs. Even if it's within a ORGANIZATION so not necessarily making a like a small business

337
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:09.470
PARTICIPANT 1 and and being more agile, II think that

338
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.230
PARTICIPANT 1that that's hard to do. And

339
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:22.630
PARTICIPANT 1most companies aren't structured for that. So II think across the board, you're seeing ORGANIZATIONs really struggle with that. And

340
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.819
PARTICIPANT 1I also think that

341
00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:31.450
PARTICIPANT 1PEOPLE realize that authority isn't necessarily based on a title.

342
00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:40.700
PARTICIPANT 1That you could. You know you could have a janitor at a school. So someone, you know, at the bottom of the ORGANIZATION chart

343
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:45.510
PARTICIPANT 1you know, be someone that could help be a positive CHANGE agent

344
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:52.350
PARTICIPANT 1or a person coming up with ideas. So II think for managers recognizing that

345
00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.829
PARTICIPANT 1PEOPLE aren't just machines, that they're organic. They can learn

346
00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.830
PARTICIPANT 1and providing those opportunities, I think, helps

347
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.760
PARTICIPANT 1helps the employee realize they have a future.

348
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:12.080
PARTICIPANT 1But then it comes back to the ORGANIZATION in terms of that innovation. Creativity.

349
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:17.170
PARTICIPANT 1But then also, I think, eventually a productivity gain.

350
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:27.309
Unice Harris: Okay? And then in those are some great ideas. in the

351
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:49.250
Unice Harris: special interest group. Articles? How do you think that impacted them? Did that work in terms of helping them or hurting them in terms of their willingness to CHANGE? With with NEW implementations. I mean, those are some

352
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:58.280
Unice Harris: really innovative ideas. How did how did it impact? Did it work in terms of their willingness to CHANGE or did it hurt?

353
00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:07.720
PARTICIPANT 1II think it depended on how involved they were. You know, I would also try find videos. So, you know, thinking of those different learning styles?

354
00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:12.740
PARTICIPANT 1We would also try to to do lunch in person. So

355
00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:16.769
PARTICIPANT 1you know, just to come and and talk about what was going well.

356
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:23.829
PARTICIPANT 1 I tried to be really careful, because in in some groups like that you could have PEOPLE come and

357
00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:37.129
PARTICIPANT 1they'll use it as a venting session to complain about. You know I'm not making ABC. Or you know, why am I not here? Or you know my salary is too low. So, being really thoughtful

358
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.250
PARTICIPANT 1to to recognize the PURPOSE. and not kind of veer from that.

359
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:49.500
PARTICIPANT 1 I do think there are some instances where you know, having

360
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:52.879
PARTICIPANT 1some of those conversations.

361
00:55:53.130 --> 00:56:06.360
PARTICIPANT 1Did help with cross functional COMMUNICATION. but I think the issue was that there wasn't a a broader recognition of a need for that. And so

362
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:21.099
PARTICIPANT 1I think eventually as I had to take on more work and stuff, I had to let it go, which which was really too bad. But II do think that while we were doing that it it did have some kind of effect.

363
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:28.730
PARTICIPANT 1 But since there wasn't broader commitment. That effect couldn't be magnified across the ORGANIZATION.

364
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.319
PARTICIPANT 1Okay, so what do you got next?

365
00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:56.500
PARTICIPANT 1A

366
00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:02.810
Unice Harris: let's see. how did the TRANSFORMATION give you

367
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:12.070
Unice Harris: employees, STAKEHOLDERS, the results they were expecting? Or did you get what you were targeting

368
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:14.350
Unice Harris: after the production?

369
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.430
PARTICIPANT 1 so II think in the context of the

370
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:29.620
PARTICIPANT 1the special interest group. II think we did. II think that expose PEOPLE to NEW ideas.

371
00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.649
PARTICIPANT 1and it brought PEOPLE together in in a way. That

372
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:42.230
PARTICIPANT 1you know, wasn't very common within that ORGANIZATION. But but again, I think because of

373
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:54.729
PARTICIPANT 1a lack of longer term SUPPORT. I think eventually it went away.  for for the other PROJECTs I had referenced. So the the virtual desktop initiative.

374
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.519
PARTICIPANT 1 you know. II think that went well. Production wise that's still being used

375
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:09.699
PARTICIPANT 1the AI adoption. So eventually, you know that that fizzled out because there wasn't enough commitment

376
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:15.250
PARTICIPANT 1 And then, as as key resources left

377
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:20.240
PARTICIPANT 1that were involved with the maintenance and SUPPORT for that those were not replaced.

378
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:27.830
PARTICIPANT 1Those were positions eliminated, or, you know, rePURPOSE to other functional areas

379
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.390
PARTICIPANT 1for the event SYSTEM

380
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:41.960
PARTICIPANT 1that I mentioned. I definitely think that's still going strong.  And then for the the Minecraft Bork, I mentioned.

381
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:50.260
PARTICIPANT 1 That's still there, but it's a huge missed opportunity. They have no idea

382
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:53.080
PARTICIPANT 1how far ahead they are of other PEOPLE.

383
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.099
PARTICIPANT 1and it's brought in revenue, but it could be

384
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.160
PARTICIPANT 1bringing in a lot more.

385
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.530
PARTICIPANT 1So it's it's something I think that's

386
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.840
PARTICIPANT 1from my perspective, been unappreciated.

387
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:13.349
PARTICIPANT 1And they have to realize that it's it's more than one functional area. It's gotta be

388
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:18.690
PARTICIPANT 1ORGANIZATION-wide and and cult, you know more of a cultural TRANSFORMATION

389
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.910
Unice Harris:  okay gotcha.

390
00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:35.800
Unice Harris: yeah, here's a question. if you had a SYSTEM that went into production that didn't give you all that you wanted. What were the lessons learned

391
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.329
as an individual?

392
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:43.280
PARTICIPANT 1Hmm! Didn't give you what you wanted.

393
00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:48.499
Unice Harris: Well, if, for example, you've implemented the desktop

394
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:57.270
Unice Harris: then the Minecraft, which I think is incredible to be a part of something that huge if

395
00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:05.349
Unice Harris:  after the rollout into production? If has there ever been

396
01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:17.069
Unice Harris: an implementation that didn't give you or the STAKEHOLDERS the end results that you were looking for. And then, if so, what were the lessons learned?

397
01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:33.300
Unice Harris: And I think you answered that because I think you already said that as individuals. We have to realize that we can't always win. So we have to do the best that we can. So for me, that answers the question, do you wanna add anything to that?

398
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:39.009
PARTICIPANT 1Well, I I think some stuff to add.

399
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:53.160
PARTICIPANT 1you know, it's it's funny. There's this quote from Machiavelli that I always bring up when I think about CHANGE that you know, in the Prince he says that most dangerous thing a

400
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.429
PARTICIPANT 1prince can do is introduce a NEW order of things or basically CHANGE. And

401
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:06.349
PARTICIPANT 1II think with everything, even if it's a NEW SYSTEM that can do all this great stuff.

402
01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:12.159
PARTICIPANT 1You have to recognize limitations. So, for example, with the

403
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.520
PARTICIPANT 1the Virtual Workspace

404
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:18.719
PARTICIPANT 1one of the big issues was that Zoom couldn't work

405
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:26.480
PARTICIPANT 1because Zoom was designed to be on a physical machine, not in a CLOUD space. You know, with Minecraft.

406
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:30.430
PARTICIPANT 1There's SYSTEM requirements for it to work properly.

407
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.349
PARTICIPANT 1And then, as we.

408
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:37.880
PARTICIPANT 1you know, we're facilitating that course experience. We had stuff happen that

409
01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.810
PARTICIPANT 1we hadn't thought about, but then also ran into problems.

410
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.350
PARTICIPANT 1Which we addressed.

411
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.850
PARTICIPANT 1You know, I

412
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.810
PARTICIPANT 1I think some of it is recognizing that

413
01:01:54.030 --> 01:02:01.809
PARTICIPANT 1with some of these SYSTEMS it could be iterative. So you might have more work to do. And I think that's where documenting.

414
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:16.550
PARTICIPANT 1you know the the lessons learned. But then also your your action items post deployment as critical and you know, recognizing that that that commitment's important. Even if

415
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.350
PARTICIPANT 1a SYSTEM

416
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:28.379
PARTICIPANT 1cannot do 10% of of what you wanted. That that's okay. You know, just as PEOPLE are not perfect. SYSTEMS are not either.

417
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.950
PARTICIPANT 1And

418
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:37.480
PARTICIPANT 1you know, recognizing you might have to iterate a little bit. But if you can get past that. You know, hump of.

419
01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:41.610
PARTICIPANT 1You know your initial deployment and stuff. II think that becomes easier.

420
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:47.829
PARTICIPANT 1I think, especially as the PROJECT winds down. And PEOPLE, you know, it becomes a way

421
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.299
PARTICIPANT 1of doing business day to day.

422
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:56.890
Unice Harris: Perfect. Thank you.  Last question.

423
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.440
Unice Harris: can you share

424
01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:22.840
Unice Harris: why you think that CHANGE. MAANAGEMENT is important or not important, and CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is incorporate is what incorporates your your TRAINING, your TESTING, your corporate-wide COMMUNICATION. All those things are CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. Can you tell me why you think those are important? Or if you think those are not important?

425
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:30.879
PARTICIPANT 1Well. I mean, if I found some one that said was not important. II don't know if they'd be in business for long.

426
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:35.350
PARTICIPANT 1 

427
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.680
PARTICIPANT 1you know. II think

428
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.189
PARTICIPANT 1If you look throughout history.

429
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:55.539
PARTICIPANT 1you know, I think CHANGE has always been an issue. And and I think what makes it unique today is the pace is a lot faster than it was in the past.

430
01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.570
PARTICIPANT 1you know, if you look at the past century in the Us.

431
01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:07.790
PARTICIPANT 1There have been huge advances for you know women and equality in the workplace.

432
01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.580
PARTICIPANT 1you know. Like, I, I'm

433
01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.989
PARTICIPANT 1we're not using a telegraph anymore. We're not, you know, SYSTEMS are getting phased out much faster.

434
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:25.350
PARTICIPANT 1So I think there's a recognition that ORGANIZATIONs need to be more agile and adaptive compared to the past.

435
01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.800
PARTICIPANT 1I think PEOPLE do, too. Even if you look at

436
01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:41.220
PARTICIPANT 1the careers that folks have, you know there was this old adage, you work at one place for 30 years. Retire, you know you get a pension. That's gone

437
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:47.290
PARTICIPANT 1for folks my age. They grew up being told they work at 15 or more different places.

438
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:59.319
PARTICIPANT 1 So so I think it'd be very naive to  to not have some level of of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT expertise

439
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:10.000
PARTICIPANT 1and I think the other part, too, is the you know, when you look at PROJECTs. So you've got, you know, the PEOPLE aspect PROCESS and TECHNOLOGY.

440
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:14.610
PARTICIPANT 1And I think sometimes the the PEOPLE part can be forgotten.

441
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.480
PARTICIPANT 1Cause. When you're working on stuff, you might have really technical PEOPLE

442
01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:31.020
PARTICIPANT 1that are good with the TECHNOLOGY or their expertise. But they're not good at communicating with PEOPLE. So finding folks that can be. That bridge between the 2 is critical.

443
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:40.049
PARTICIPANT 1 I've even heard within the next decade. So just as there's more PROJECT managers than there were in the past. There might even be.

444
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:47.429
PARTICIPANT 1CHANGE, managers that all they do is figure out, you know. How do we get to that current state, to the future state.

445
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:55.339
PARTICIPANT 1And I think in some ways PROJECT managers already do that. They're just not formally call CHANGE managers. But

446
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:58.879
PARTICIPANT 1 I definitely think that

447
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:02.959
PARTICIPANT 1that a working knowledge of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT.

448
01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:10.200
PARTICIPANT 1you know, it's critical. And II even remember studying PROJECT MAANAGEMENT. II saw a statistic that

449
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.059
PARTICIPANT 1 I think this was from like the late 90 s. The 80% of

450
01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:18.080
PARTICIPANT 1of initiatives that aren't managed while failed.

451
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:25.030
PARTICIPANT 1And I saw something from an AI article that came out. I think it was last year.

452
01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:33.100
PARTICIPANT 1It said that two-thirds of all PROJECTs fail every year. So imagine spending. you know.

453
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:39.020
PARTICIPANT 1tens of billions of dollars across your economy every year on, on failed initiatives.

454
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:46.320
PARTICIPANT 1 you know that's terrible. That money could go somewhere else, and I think that's where

455
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:49.520
PARTICIPANT 1you know managing stuff very intentionally.

456
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:55.639
PARTICIPANT 1You know this idea of going, you know, going slow and then going fast.

457
01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.310
PARTICIPANT 1Being agile. I think that's gonna be critical

458
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:06.430
PARTICIPANT 1today. But then also, as we move into industry, 5 and beyond

459
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:11.990
Unice Harris: great answer.

460
01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:20.880
Unice Harris: great, great, great great answer. No, that's a great, great, great answer.

461
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:43.469
Unice Harris: So listen. I want to thank you for taking the time today and answering these 9 questions. you have a vast amount of experience, and it's going to go a long ways in terms of adding to the body of knowledge. And it's going to be

462
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:53.129
Unice Harris: invaluable for this study. So let me take a moment in this conversation. Turn off the recording hang on 1 s.


PARTICIPANT 2 TRANSCRIPTS

WEBVTT

1
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.850
Unice Harris: Okay, I'm about to go on my MEETING.

2
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.100
Unice Harris: You're right now.

3
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.580
Unice Harris: Scripture.

4
00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.199
Unice Harris: Message 4, 8, 1, 6, 8, 0.

5
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.110
Unice Harris: How many?

6
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.339
Good afternoon. Can you hear me?

7
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.390
Unice Harris: I think you're on mute. That's not

8
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:46.580
Unice Harris: Hi. Yes, I'm here. I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Thank you so much for participating. I greatly appreciate it.

9
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:59.899
PARTICIPANT 2 Not a problem. Are we doing this on camera or off camera? We'll do it off camera. And if you click, please. Send your

10
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.760
Unice Harris: form consent, form back to me.

11
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.419
PARTICIPANT 2 Should I just EMAIL it back? Okay.

12
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.970
Unice Harris: you can EMAIL it back. And we just send it through Linkedin, which is convenient for you. That way, I

13
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:37.340
Unice Harris: and the informed consent just basically said that you consent to participating in the study, and that nobody forced you, and you understand that you cannot participate. And then it talks to you about the privacy, and how I will keep your INFORMATION completely confidential.

14
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.129
PARTICIPANT 2 Yes, I will send it back. I just need to find

15
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.629
PARTICIPANT 2 it. But III completed it, but that was one of the questions I was gonna ask you if E, if EMAILing it back would be fine.

16
00:05:51.630 --> 00:06:20.109
Unice Harris: Yep, that's just fine. So I will. I will go ahead and get started. Thank you so much again for participating. Your experience is invaluable to the study, and it's a blessing to just get your perspective of some of the things that are going on within the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION space. So I'll just go ahead and start with number one, and we have 9 questions that that will just work through

17
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:35.210
Unice Harris: during the initiation, or any other phase or start of the PROJECT. Can you share a time when you communicated the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION, and how it would enhance or help the ORGANIZATION.

18
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.990
PARTICIPANT 2 Sure, I will go back to 2020. I work for public sector.

19
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:58.319
PARTICIPANT 2 local government. And in 2020, when we were faced with the global pandemic one of the PROCESSES in which

20
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:06.249
PARTICIPANT 2 vendors would submit their invoices to the city was very, very heavy paper based.

21
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.999
PARTICIPANT 2 and the push to

22
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:15.650
PARTICIPANT 2 have electronic submissions was put on the table for discussion and consideration

23
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:38.419
PARTICIPANT 2 because one because we were all under stay at home, orders that also meant that Staff was not able to be in office to receive review and PROCESS invoices to vendors who obviously would need to be paid for services that they've provided to the city. So that was the my first

24
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:44.790
PARTICIPANT 2 biggest DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROJECT is

25
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:57.360
PARTICIPANT 2 moving ahead with the design, development and implementation of an enterprise wide initiative to move the city from. And I laugh because it's, you know, it's

26
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:04.320
PARTICIPANT 2 really behind times a paper based PROCESS to a more DIGITAL PROCESS

27
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:14.110
PARTICIPANT 2 and and basic DIGITAL meaning just rather than have someone print 3 copies of invoices, mail that in or

28
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:32.510
PARTICIPANT 2 deliver that in person. Now we're just gonna ask them to EMAIL it through the centralized delivery SYSTEM where they can upload their invoices and the SUPPORT and documents, and the SYSTEM will then push that out to the respective DEPARTMENTs.

29
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:51.699
Unice Harris: And you, did you communicate that the PURPOSE? Or did did someone on the TEAM communicate the PURPOSE of that PROJECT at the very start to everybody within the ORGANIZATION, or did they just communicate it to specific PEOPLE?

30
00:08:51.930 --> 00:09:01.159
PARTICIPANT 2 No, I manage the COMMUNICATION between myself, the PROJECT sponsor There were a number of

31
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:22.210
PARTICIPANT 2 DEPARTMENTs that were high priority core members. So conversation first happened within. Let's say that stratosphere and then commuting heavy COMMUNICATION out to DEPARTMENTs. DEPARTMENT leadership first, so that we have

32
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:34.779
PARTICIPANT 2 BUYIN from them, and understanding from leadership of their respective DEPARTMENTs. And this is the direction that we're going. Also communicates in very heavily to fiscal staff

33
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:48.280
PARTICIPANT 2  to inform them that this is what the NEW PROCESS will be moving forward getting them up to speed trained familiar with the portal that was being designed and developed.

34
00:09:48.450 --> 00:10:05.139
PARTICIPANT 2 And also COMMUNICATION to our vendor community, informing them that this would be the NEW PROCESS by a certain date. How the city would like to receive invoices. You know, for

35
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.669
PARTICIPANT 2 at that time the the urgency behind

36
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:26.979
PARTICIPANT 2 moving to a more electronic PROCESS, because, you know, offices are not staffed, we're under stay at home order. And then eventually, as the reactions and feedback came in about this NEW PROCESS and the challenges and the the push back

37
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:39.239
PARTICIPANT 2 just navigating everyone from leadership of different DEPARTMENTs, fiscal staff vendors, even some of our STAKEHOLDERS,

38
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:54.479
PARTICIPANT 2 who had certain expectations having to navigate having to navigate COMMUNICATION with them to ensure that there was alignment at all stages of the PROJECT.

39
00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:07.170
Unice Harris: That's good INFORMATION? And then how did you communicate? That was that through EMAIL, through a shared site, through MEETINGS? Or was it a combination of all of that.

40
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:21.760
PARTICIPANT 2 It was a combination of all of that we were MEETING in person up until we were not able to be in the office together. Then we heavily relied on TECHNOLOGY. Beyond just EMAILing

41
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:45.520
PARTICIPANT 2 TEAMS. My, utilize in Microsoft TEAMS was very, very, very critical in our daily COMMUNICATION. Not just MEETINGS for for broad general MEETINGS, but for TEAM huddles and MEETING with different PROJECT TEAMS who had different work streams within the PROCESS.

42
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:58.970
PARTICIPANT 2 That instant messaging was very, very needed cause. As things were developing and changing and features were being built, decisions had to be made very, very quickly. So

43
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:14.759
PARTICIPANT 2 we pivoted from in person MEETINGS to heavy use of Ms TEAMS Sharepoint site for document MAANAGEMENT and EMAILing for exCHANGE. More

44
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.840
PARTICIPANT 2 more long form of COMMUNICATION.

45
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:30.679
Unice Harris: And that's good INFORMATION. Thank you for sharing that. Do you feel like by doing all of that? Do you get? Did you feel like it minimized confusion about the PURPOSE of the PROJECT.

46
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:51.729
PARTICIPANT 2 I don't know if it minimize confusion. What I felt it did was it was over COMMUNICATION which was needed. Because at that time given what we were all dealing with, not just professionally, but in our personal life and just

47
00:12:51.960 --> 00:13:02.700
PARTICIPANT 2 being in, in, in in the throes of the pandemic INFORMATION sharing was very critical. PEOPLE needed to know

48
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:10.400
PARTICIPANT 2 and be reminded, why are we doing this? How is this gonna help. Why are we? You know why now?

49
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:24.439
PARTICIPANT 2  questioning. And you know, we gave space for them to question, and I definitely had to feel a lot of the answers like, why, now, why this particular tool? What are some of the features?

50
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:36.900
PARTICIPANT 2 I've been in this role for 15 years or 40 years, and we've never done it this way. So we had to over communicate, reiterate constantly. And

51
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:44.320
PARTICIPANT 2 II can't say and minimize confusion, but it really gave assurance that

52
00:13:44.650 --> 00:14:13.240
PARTICIPANT 2 such a big and bold move was being managed, and that there was a face or a person behind it that they can connect with and meaning Staff City staff from any level, as well as vendors who were reaching out because they were hearing that this is happening, and they were concerned on how they would get paid. So COMMUNICATION helped with, I would say, assurance

53
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.290
PARTICIPANT 2 more than confusion. Okay.

54
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:27.100
Unice Harris: I like that INFORMATION. Thank you for sharing it. Can you share a time when you didn't communicate the PURPOSE of

55
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:35.790
Unice Harris: the TRANSFORMATION, and how that PROJECT was a little bit different, because in your

56
00:14:35.790 --> 00:15:05.239
Unice Harris: in your the assessment that you just shared with me. Everybody was pulled together, and everybody kNEW at every stage of the PROJECT what things were going to be, and there was a lot of assurance there that, you know, if they had any questions they kNEW where to go. They kNEW what the PURPOSE, of what the of the PROJECT was. And that makes it easier to facilitate a completion. So can you tell me a time where you didn't do all of those things.

57
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:17.609
PARTICIPANT 2 Yes, there was another DIGITALly TRANSFORMative initiative where the COMMUNICATION was not as broad

58
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:28.100
PARTICIPANT 2 to to the enterprise. It was very specific to the core DEPARTMENTs that were involved. However.

59
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.450
PARTICIPANT 2 the

60
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:38.040
PARTICIPANT 2 conversations around design and implementation. In fact, there. There was a lot of gaps

61
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:49.480
PARTICIPANT 2 in that, and with on that particular PROJECT. There was a lot of confusion. There was wasn't wasn't as SUCCESSFUL with BUYIN.

62
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.570
PARTICIPANT 2 Because

63
00:15:52.670 --> 00:16:03.430
PARTICIPANT 2 how we were. The approach we took was, we're sort of build it. and then they'll come type of approach rather than

64
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:18.849
PARTICIPANT 2 get input and BUYIN earlier on. So with taking that approach, COMMUNICATION was limited. It was obvious where there were INFORMATION gaps, but it was also by design that that that PROJECT was

65
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.569
PARTICIPANT 2 structures like that.

66
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:37.310
Unice Harris: Perfect. Thank you. And I think you already answered question, too. But just in case you want to add a little bit more to it, question was during the requirements or any other phase of the TRANSFORMATION. Did you share

67
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:50.669
Unice Harris: how you inform the cross functional TEAMS or the ORGANIZATION up as a whole, of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically, and how it would affect or impact or enhance

68
00:16:50.670 --> 00:17:15.059
Unice Harris: how they do their work every day. And I think you answered that with the the PROJECT where you're moving them from heavy paper to electronic based transmission. You said that you guys took the extra steps to, you know, inform. You know the stake not only the STAKEHOLDERS, but the ORGANIZATION as a whole. And the cross impact

69
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:22.630
TEAMS. Want to elaborate on that. Any further, you will make kind of take what you've already said in question. Number one.

70
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:32.589
PARTICIPANT 2 Well, II let me see if I can give some more detail around that. So EMAILing

71
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.359
PARTICIPANT 2 the detailed

72
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:46.980
PARTICIPANT 2 structure and roadmap, so to speak, on how we were gonna go about this initiative. In addition to that we also facilitated

73
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:56.440
PARTICIPANT 2 MEETINGS where it was. Our our audience was very targeted. It would be identifying fiscal staff

74
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:10.710
PARTICIPANT 2 or finance staff within the enterprise to take their questions. As well as so we're when I say, take their questions. So if we have fiscal staff, we have

75
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:27.630
PARTICIPANT 2 members of the fiscal staff who are primarily responsible for just receiving and acknowledging or creating a receipt of the invoice. So they would have specific questions. So we met with that target group. Then we met with the accounting

76
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:38.809
PARTICIPANT 2 Or the accountants throughout the city. They're the ones that or the as well as the contract managers, so they would have very specific questions as a contract manager

77
00:18:39.100 --> 00:19:01.639
PARTICIPANT 2 need in specific pieces of INFORMATION for their portions of the work. How how would we ensure that they got their pieces or how do we ensure that fraud is not happening? So we also identified specific expertise within the enterprise and have very specific

78
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:12.860
PARTICIPANT 2 targeted MEETINGS to answer their questions, to help inform, clarify, guide. seek, BUYIN on what we were doing.

79
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:22.699
Unice Harris: Got it? Okay? Thank you very much. And I think you just kind of you're leading into the next question,

80
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.309
Unice Harris: in the design phase, or any other phase

81
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:45.780
Unice Harris: before development of the TRANSFORMATION life cycle? Can you share how you provided TRAINING relative to the NEW PROCESS or NEW TECHNOLOGY? How you provided you know them with with TRAINING on how to use the NEW TECHNOLOGY.

82
00:19:47.180 --> 00:20:05.609
PARTICIPANT 2 What with the utilizing the NEW TECHNOLOGY, and that piece of TECHNOLOGY was a portal I facilitated. Sorry numerous demos. So I was trained by the developers on the back end of how to use the SYSTEM

83
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:14.939
PARTICIPANT 2 both from a user perspective meaning the vendor as well as a internal city staff personnel.

84
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:38.989
PARTICIPANT 2 So I was trained by developers. On that. Then I constructed and facilitated demos for fiscal staff contract managers lead a different leadership throughout the city on what the user experience would be like and what the back end experience for their fiscal staff would be like.

85
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.980
okay?

86
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:55.099
Unice Harris: And then on the flip side of that. It makes it easier when they know what they know how to use the SYSTEMS.

87
00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:14.069
Unice Harris: And you know, you, you implement it kind of like the train, the trainer type scenario where again the developers train do. And you took that knowledge and trained everybody who would be impacted by the SYSTEM. Can you share a time when you didn't provide any TRAINING at all? And how did that work out.

88
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:19.410
PARTICIPANT 2 Yeah, based on how? That

89
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:32.740
PARTICIPANT 2 the nature of of that particular PROJECT where there were DEPARTMENTs that did not BUYINto it, and as a result missed opportunity to train them because

90
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:41.650
PARTICIPANT 2 they were not sold on this particular tool. They still wanted the PROCESS, the old PROCESS. So as a result of that

91
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:49.109
PARTICIPANT 2 some TEAMS and within the first year that did not BUYINto it, they.

92
00:21:49.470 --> 00:22:13.189
PARTICIPANT 2 they, as well as ourselves, would have issues with vendors because there's COMMUNICATION out there, and their vendors are. Some of them are confused on whether they should send the INFORMATION via the portal, or they should send it in the traditional way, and because of that it really

93
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.149
PARTICIPANT 2 muddied the waters when we did not have complete BUYIN

94
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:32.599
PARTICIPANT 2 from those DEPARTMENTs, and then we would see a year and a half later, 2 years later, some of these very DEPARTMENTs that I had reached out to some of them are reaching out to ask for TRAINING, because

95
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:39.800
PARTICIPANT 2 ex person who was responsible before never informed fiscal staff that

96
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.120
PARTICIPANT 2 there was this

97
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:53.499
PARTICIPANT 2 TECHNOLOGY that they can use or X person left, and now they're in charge, and they want to understand. So

98
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:59.490
PARTICIPANT 2 I would say, because some DEPARTMENTs did not completely buy. And they it created a

99
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:10.519
PARTICIPANT 2 INFORMATION vacuum for that respective DEPARTMENT, and as a result it created confusion for vendors as well as

100
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.940
PARTICIPANT 2 narratives on

101
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:27.660
PARTICIPANT 2 the utility of this piece of TECHNOLOGY, good, bad, or indifferent other narratives were created and passed, so it did create some confusion for those who are not

102
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.510
PARTICIPANT 2 engaged in any TRAINING of any kind.

103
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:58.870
Unice Harris: So when for those that engage in the TRAINING, and we're able to get onto the SYSTEM and use it the way it was intended to be? Did that create an easier PROCESS? Flow? For executing those transactions electronically versus in paper? And did it somehow increase REVENUEover a over a period of time

104
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:12.000
PARTICIPANT 2 there, that that is a mixed response. I have for some DEPARTMENTs who did utilize the the TECHNOLOGY, the portal.

105
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:17.819
PARTICIPANT 2 For some of them it challenged. What the internal PROCESS is.

106
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.350
Unice Harris: if that if they were accustomed to getting invoices mailed in.

107
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:47.529
PARTICIPANT 2 if they were, if they have 2 staff members, for example, if they have 2 staff members that receive physical invoices, they, you know, have staff members who are under utilize because invoices are coming in electronically as a result of an example like that. It then challenge

108
00:24:47.770 --> 00:25:07.180
PARTICIPANT 2 each respective DEPARTMENT to think about what the internal PROCESSES with the implementation of the tool we never dictated how a DEPARTMENT needs to PROCESS invoices so, and that was intentional.

109
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:16.690
PARTICIPANT 2 But for some DEPARTMENTs that challenge was either a good thing or not a good thing, a good thing in the sense that they accepted.

110
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:33.370
PARTICIPANT 2 They accepted the CHANGES that are required, and how they PROCESS and made CHANGES, whether it's through their policy and their practice, and how they're going to review and approve invoices electronically

111
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:47.349
PARTICIPANT 2 or for some of them, it was really Re and still isn't. 3 years later. For some of them it's still very difficult for them to make that complete pivot, and they still utilize the old way of

112
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.990
PARTICIPANT 2 of getting invoices

113
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:58.180
PARTICIPANT 2 other part. To your question you were asking about revenue. Well, in public sector, our bottom line is never really revenue.

114
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.649
PARTICIPANT 2 Our bottom line tends to be more impact

115
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:09.079
PARTICIPANT 2 and in some cases there were significant impact

116
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:18.149
PARTICIPANT 2 on productivity, so invoices were being PROCESSed at a faster rate

117
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:35.129
PARTICIPANT 2 within a certain amount of time. So within the second year the data shows that within the second year of the portal being stood up, 70% of invoices received via the portal will PROCESS, and under 30 days

118
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.570
Unice Harris: oh, as opposed to

119
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:43.080
PARTICIPANT 2 prior to the portal, invoices were not being paid

120
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:50.120
PARTICIPANT 2 in some extreme cases for 6 months or 90 days or 60 days.

121
00:26:50.650 --> 00:27:00.189
PARTICIPANT 2 but through the the standing up of the Porto and invoices being submitted through that piece of TECHNOLOGY, we were able to

122
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:10.519
PARTICIPANT 2 track and determine that within the second, here we saw a an increase in in productivity, in how fast

123
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.420
PARTICIPANT 2 invoices were being reviewed and PROCESSed. Electronic.

124
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.469
Unice Harris: Okay, Gotcha perfect.

125
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.960
Unice Harris: so not necessarily

126
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:31.180
Unice Harris: increase revenue, but increase the efficiency that your REVENUEwas paid

127
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.249
Unice Harris: per se. That would be an accurate okay.

128
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.809
Unice Harris: which is still good.

129
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:47.149
Unice Harris: which is still good, because if you think about you're getting paid your revenue

130
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.520
70%

131
00:27:50.900 --> 00:28:06.160
Unice Harris: more effectively in the second year versus waiting 6 months to get your revenue. Now you're getting it within 30, 60, 90 days because you're getting

132
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:27.000
Unice Harris: because your invoices are electronic and not paper correct. I got it. That's perfect. Oh, my gosh! You need to be everywhere in this city, cause they still are. There are a lot of locations that are still heavy ladies on paper invoices.

133
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:50.450
Unice Harris: Question number 4 in the TESTING phase of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION lifecycle. Can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS? Maybe a user acceptance test to confirm that it works the way it should before go live or tell me how you test it? Or did you test at all. Yeah, we did a user acceptance test before we went live.

134
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.979
And that that was myself.

135
00:28:54.190 --> 00:29:03.340
PARTICIPANT 2  in in the role of a user as well as a few city staff to

136
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.389
PARTICIPANT 2  to provide feedback on what the

137
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.559
PARTICIPANT 2 user experience was.

138
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.100
Unice Harris: Okay.

139
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.130
Unice Harris: hey?

140
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:32.899
Unice Harris: Okay, and then can you share a time where you did not do any TESTING at all. Was that a different, a very, very different outcome when you didn't use any test?

141
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:46.520
PARTICIPANT 2 No, we. We have always used some user TESTING. at least on the PROJECTs that I've been on. Yes.

142
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.920
Unice Harris: good. Good. Good.

143
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.599
Unice Harris: Okay.

144
00:29:55.370 --> 00:30:11.090
Unice Harris: Question. Number 5 after the rollout into production. How are end users, employees, and STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback relative to what worked in production and what seemed to not work smoothly?

145
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:20.280
PARTICIPANT 2 I would say we didn't do a good job in that space.

146
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:33.529
PARTICIPANT 2 the we we sort of left the feedback loop to come in through EMAILS like, you know if you have any questions or concerns, you can EMAIL

147
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.730
PARTICIPANT 2 this

148
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.370
PARTICIPANT 2 EMAIL address. So we did that.

149
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:49.669
PARTICIPANT 2 maybe one other timing about 6 months after the TECHNOLOGY was stood up. I did a SURVEY

150
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:55.180
PARTICIPANT 2  but there wasn't

151
00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:01.470
PARTICIPANT 2 a well structured or designed to

152
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.949
PARTICIPANT 2 capture ongoing feedback on concerns.

153
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:17.739
PARTICIPANT 2  if a DEPARTMENT had an issue, it could be a one off issue. They would then reach out individually and say, XY, and Z is the case, and then we'll try to

154
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.330
PARTICIPANT 2 remediate what the the issue is. Got it? Okay?

155
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:36.610
Unice Harris: So when they roll this out into production and didn't provide a way for them to communicate.

156
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.070
Their experiences.

157
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:48.749
Unice Harris: Let's roll forward to maybe the next PROJECT. Do you feel like how that particular PROJECT was managed?

158
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:58.860
Unice Harris: Did impacted members of the ORGANIZATION seem more receptive to CHANGE or more hesitant to CHANGE.

159
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:07.639
PARTICIPANT 2 that that, too, is a mixed bag. because there are some folks who are

160
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:22.940
PARTICIPANT 2 who are actually vested in citizen technologies. CHANGES with technologies to not be SUCCESSFUL. So it's also like, I told you so.

161
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:29.470
PARTICIPANT 2 So. We have those players. And then we also have the the players who

162
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.940
PARTICIPANT 2 are vested in wanting data to be SUCCESS

163
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:45.540
PARTICIPANT 2  in these TRANSFORMative PROJECTs and they are open to given suggestions.

164
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.319
PARTICIPANT 2 Providing feedback in a in A very, with.

165
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:54.180
PARTICIPANT 2 you know, very constructive feedback that is useful.

166
00:32:54.290 --> 00:33:07.349
PARTICIPANT 2 And then for myself, as a PROJECT manager, having seen what worked, what didn't work, what we could do, a better job, and just making note of those lessons learned, so that

167
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:13.409
PARTICIPANT 2 I take that with me on future PROJECTs. And then

168
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.890
PARTICIPANT 2 and then could speak to

169
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:27.790
PARTICIPANT 2 conversation around other TRANSFORMative PROJECTs, things that we need to think of much earlier on.

170
00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:32.370
Unice Harris: Okay. perfect. Okay, that makes perfect sense.

171
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.710
Question. Number 6,

172
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:43.099
Unice Harris: can you share an example of a DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION that went very well. And you've already done that. You shared that

173
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:47.599
the transition from paper to electronic.

174
00:33:47.690 --> 00:34:10.239
Unice Harris: And I like that. That was really precise. The way you did that. And you elaborated off some of those PEOPLE who wanted to kind of lag behind and not pick up the NEW TECHNOLOGY. So they were requesting TRAINING. A year or 2 years after you guys were already done. So you kind of elaborated on that a little bit. Also.

175
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:20.269
Unice Harris: you talked a little bit about a product that didn't go so well. So I think you've covered that question. 6. Do you want to elaborate any further on that?

176
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.590
Yeah, I can.

177
00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.879
PARTICIPANT 2 with that that particular PROJECT.

178
00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:35.940
PARTICIPANT 2 I'll give you a a little more context. So, for example.

179
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.500
PARTICIPANT 2 the

180
00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:45.709
PARTICIPANT 2 residents of the city, if they wanted to apply for a specific BENEFIT, as it is right now to day.

181
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.730
PARTICIPANT 2 If they wanted assistance with taxes.

182
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:58.069
PARTICIPANT 2 Some type of tax relief if they wanted assistance with home repair or their water bill.

183
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.169
PARTICIPANT 2 So we're talking about tax relief. That's the DEPARTMENT of Revenue

184
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:13.369
PARTICIPANT 2 Water Bill, that is, with the Water REVENUEhome repair. That's with planning and development. They would have to go to each specific DEPARTMENT

185
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:21.940
PARTICIPANT 2 to get INFORMATION, either from their website or speak to someone on staff

186
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.720
PARTICIPANT 2 or in Poussin.

187
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:33.370
PARTICIPANT 2 There's no centralized way where myself, as a resident, if I have a need in each specific area

188
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:44.769
PARTICIPANT 2 that I could go on line. submit an application, or submit an inquiry and get INFORMATION on my eligibility for these 3 things. Okay, Gotcha.

189
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:57.459
PARTICIPANT 2 And we were trying to develop a tool, a common application tool that would allow a resident who has some proficiency with TECHNOLOGY to

190
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:04.169
PARTICIPANT 2 access this common application either on their mobile phone or on their desktop.

191
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:16.080
PARTICIPANT 2 and put in specific personal INFORMATION. For example, understanding their income number of persons in their household, if they

192
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:22.509
PARTICIPANT 2 are if they have some form of disability as part of eligibility.

193
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:44.530
PARTICIPANT 2 Questioning to determine. Okay, although you may have a need, a housing issue based off of all of the INFORMATION that you've provided, we also see that you are eligible for some medical program, and that's based on the person's personal INFORMATION.

194
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:59.220
PARTICIPANT 2 So that tool with it being an eligibility screener, the BENEFIT is allowing this person to enter in their INFORMATION and not only find out INFORMATION about the program they made.

195
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:07.270
PARTICIPANT 2 Think they're interested in or are interested in. But hey, here are some of the services that the city could provide you as well.

196
00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:17.639
PARTICIPANT 2 and that proved to be that PROJECT proved to be difficult to get off the ground. Because one. I think everyone defined

197
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:29.579
PARTICIPANT 2  the problem and the challenge differently. We did not have a uniform definition of what the problem is, we, I think we had more of a a solution driven

198
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:44.979
PARTICIPANT 2 approach than clearly understanding what the problem is and how this common application was really going to answer the or be the solution to the problem. That we

199
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.320
PARTICIPANT 2 did not, you know, uniformly agree upon. So

200
00:37:49.730 --> 00:38:03.750
PARTICIPANT 2 coming to the table with the Dev TEAM was really challenging, because in one light were communicated, were going in the direction of right. But then you had other DEPARTMENTs

201
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.260
PARTICIPANT 2 who were

202
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:19.039
PARTICIPANT 2 engage in with outside vendors or tools that they think may help them in the short run for the very thing that we were working with the developers on to build

203
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.210
PARTICIPANT 2 in-house.

204
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.960
Unice Harris: Okay.

205
00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:30.670
PARTICIPANT 2 And were they doing this at the same time? They were doing it at the same time? Oh, my gosh! And despite having

206
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.379
PARTICIPANT 2 bi weekly MEETINGS with set agendas.

207
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:51.049
PARTICIPANT 2 and then, you know, a a MEETING forum that allowed for you know what are some updates? What is the? And that was the other big piece to data sharing was very challenging. Some folks did not want to

208
00:38:51.250 --> 00:39:03.040
PARTICIPANT 2 divulge the adido or do any data sharing, because it also puts them in a position. For example, if they are being funded by

209
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.820
you know the city and from different

210
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.440
PARTICIPANT 2 tax

211
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:23.720
PARTICIPANT 2 pay his dollars essentially. And there's a under utilization of the program. It then exposes them to the how and the why and the what or the how come, you know we're PROJECTing that

212
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:34.010
PARTICIPANT 2 this particular service is, should help 4,000 Philadelphians. So why is it only that 1,200

213
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:38.369
PARTICIPANT 2 Philadelphians have accessed your

214
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.640
PARTICIPANT 2 service?

215
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:44.589
PARTICIPANT 2 So data sharing was very, very challenging

216
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:58.430
PARTICIPANT 2 And and because of that transparency was impacted. And you know, as we're going along, we're learning. And we're seeing like, oh, this DEPARTMENT has launched this

217
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:10.370
PARTICIPANT 2 eligibility screening tool. But aren't we building that for them? So it was. It still proved to be very, very, very messy and unSUCCESSFUL, and

218
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:25.290
PARTICIPANT 2 maybe a year, maybe 2 years into it we we pull the plug temporarily. There just wasn't alignment and transparency on

219
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:31.220
PARTICIPANT 2  what the problem is, and how this tool

220
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.190
PARTICIPANT 2 is supposed to

221
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:49.170
PARTICIPANT 2 bring them resolution or SUPPORT to Philadelphians, so that that that also leads into the next question, because you have so many moving pieces, and so many PEOPLE moving in different directions.

222
00:40:49.170 --> 00:41:10.870
Unice Harris: Because they were not willing to CHANGE what they were already doing, or they felt like they had a better way to do it. Can you share anything that you were able to do in that situation, or another situation that would create a more DIGITAL innovation mindset within the ORGANIZATION.

223
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:21.630
PARTICIPANT 2 Sure. So after we pull the plug on that first iteration of it, we have since

224
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:34.890
PARTICIPANT 2 had one. My DEPARTMENT. We are now owning the PROJECT part of the charges that we did not own the PROJECT. We were just providing the PROJECT MAANAGEMENT capacity to move the PROJECT.

225
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:54.420
PARTICIPANT 2 and by now taking ownership of the PROJECT, we get to define what the problem is. But before we define what the problem is, we conducted our own research. We employed the assistance of

226
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.030
PARTICIPANT 2 service design researchers

227
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:11.489
Unice Harris: some of them with a data science background, psychology background. So we employed that type of expertise to help us conduct research

228
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:16.899
PARTICIPANT 2 on the BENEFITS access landscape of the city.

229
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:29.159
Unice Harris: So who are the DEPARTMENTs? Who are the staff? What are the programs? How long these programs been in existence? Who's funding the program? What is their data saying?

230
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.260
PARTICIPANT 2 And

231
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:38.649
PARTICIPANT 2 we're able. We've since been able to get a better idea of the landscape of

232
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.349
PARTICIPANT 2 city BENEFITS.

233
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.630
PARTICIPANT 2 That the city offers who the players are. We have convened

234
00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.120
PARTICIPANT 2 our

235
00:42:48.270 --> 00:43:04.570
PARTICIPANT 2  selected and convened our PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS, so because we now own it, we get to invite and and and think really critically on the expertise that we need at the table

236
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:19.579
PARTICIPANT 2 in this space in various capacities. So we've had folks who are in the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION space from the policy side, from the education side, we have data sciences. We have

237
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:35.169
PARTICIPANT 2 diversity and inclusion specialists on the TEAM. those who the expertise for folks who are like community development practitioners,

238
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:44.009
PARTICIPANT 2 folks from the office of for PEOPLE with disabilities.

239
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.780
PARTICIPANT 2 Umhm as well. And

240
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:59.470
PARTICIPANT 2 and of course, program MAANAGEMENT me. Me? So right now we have a nice blend of expertise at the table to

241
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:11.209
PARTICIPANT 2 help guide and inform us on the development of of the tool moving forward. And then.

242
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:17.119
Unice Harris: So I think what I'm understanding you to say is that by employing the expertise

243
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:36.619
Unice Harris: in research that you needed upfront to determine the true BENEFITS. And having the right PEOPLE at the table early in the PROCESS helped to ascertain the true value, and that subsequently helped to create a more DIGITAL mindset.

244
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.729
Unice Harris: Is that, did I get that right?

245
00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.880
Unice Harris: Okay.

246
00:44:45.660 --> 00:45:05.960
Unice Harris: perfect. I think you answered this one, too. Number 8, after roll out into production? How did the TRANSFORMATION give you or the employees and STAKEHOLDERS the results that were expected. So I think in the

247
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.040
Unice Harris: move to

248
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:16.760
Unice Harris: from paper to electronic, you said there was a 70% increase in PROCESSing

249
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:22.250
Unice Harris: invoices. And that's really, really good. That's definitely getting what you set out to get.

250
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.970
Unice Harris: Do you want to further elaborate on that?

251
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:40.969
PARTICIPANT 2  no, not till II mean, we're doing well. We're doing steady right now because we are

252
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:49.830
PARTICIPANT 2 heading into year 3, or maybe year 4 of it of implementation. We're looking at other metrics

253
00:45:50.090 --> 00:46:07.740
PARTICIPANT 2 that we can track. One of the metrics that is very important is understanding the utilization from minority, own businesses, minority women own disabled own business enterprises. Are they using

254
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:14.870
PARTICIPANT 2 the portal? And that's important to the city overall because it

255
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.449
PARTICIPANT 2 it helps us to

256
00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:27.509
PARTICIPANT 2 understand or helps our leadership to understand. Our minority. Women own businesses getting contracts with the city.

257
00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:50.019
PARTICIPANT 2 The their u utilization of the portal, you know, informs us of the number of women owned businesses, those or minority owned businesses or disabled own businesses. So it's giving. It's helping us to drill down a bit more on the metrics that we want to capture.

258
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.340
Unice Harris: Okay, wonderful

259
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.230
and

260
00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:12.630
Unice Harris: question number 9. And the last question, can you share why you think CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important or is not important to DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. And when I speak of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT, that is what I

261
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:34.669
Unice Harris: refer to as TRAINING, early BUYIN all those types of things is what I identify as being CHANGE MAANAGEMENT, you know, creating that awareness? All of those types of things can you share? Why you feel like that's important, or why you feel like it's not important.

262
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.430
PARTICIPANT 2 Sure. I would say in public sector.

263
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.149
PARTICIPANT 2 it is critical for us to have CHANGE MAANAGEMENT.

264
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:51.039
PARTICIPANT 2 From my experiences on both

265
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.909
PARTICIPANT 2 DIGITAL TRANSFORMative PROJECTs. I have seen an experience where.

266
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.630
PARTICIPANT 2 when there is no buy, in what

267
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:14.410
PARTICIPANT 2 obstacles are created. When you know, trying to design and develop a product

268
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:24.200
PARTICIPANT 2 as well as I've seen where, when there is BUYIN, you have your CHAMPIONs, you have your advocates. You have that built in SUPPORT.

269
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:33.880
PARTICIPANT 2  But I would say that, particularly in public sector, it's very critical to have that CHANGE MAANAGEMENT piece because

270
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:42.639
PARTICIPANT 2 it does impact the employees who are the ones that are really driving.

271
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:58.650
PARTICIPANT 2 You know, our programs and services and getting their input there has been a culture where they're almost like the last to know. They're just told that this is what you're going to do, and I think that is a huge, huge misstep.

272
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:05.679
PARTICIPANT 2 It would be to our advantage to to move into

273
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:09.929
PARTICIPANT 2 a more PEOPLE, centered or human centered

274
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:14.150
PARTICIPANT 2 world it within the city, to

275
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:43.109
PARTICIPANT 2 to take into consideration, not just the end user, but in some cases our end user or one of our users are employees. So if you're gonna implement any type of NEW TECHNOLOGY. You need employees to need that needs to be trained or up skilled. Or you need to explain to employees why this particular PROCESS is beneficial, or in some cases understand why they

276
00:49:44.000 --> 00:50:10.910
PARTICIPANT 2 follow a particular workflow. The way that they do. Is there an inefficiency, or is that a workaround? Because there is some type of bottleneck somewhere, and they've just created their own workaround. So we need to have CHANGE MAANAGEMENT because it's very complex. It's a complex thing behind the scenes in providing a service.

277
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:17.550
PARTICIPANT 2 or or let me walk that back. particularly when we are

278
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:37.350
PARTICIPANT 2 our line of business is about service delivery. So there's a lot of things behind the scenes, and CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is critical to the SUCCESS and MAANAGEMENT and running of any service that the that is being provided to the public.

279
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:58.139
PARTICIPANT 2 It's not just the end user. It's not just the public value created from, you know, giving someone tax relief or giving someone a service of some kind. But the the staff that have to work within antiquated SYSTEMS. How can we

280
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:06.020
PARTICIPANT 2  upskill staff that needs to be upskilled? How can we bring them along

281
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:17.770
PARTICIPANT 2 in the PROCESS rather than just have a culture of this is what we're going to do. Or you train a select few and not really get BUYIN from them.

282
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:47.779
Unice Harris: Perfect. great. So this has been tremendously beneficial. You have a wealth of experience and just again. Invaluable to you know, getting your perspective on, you know, CHANGE MAANAGEMENT and DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. And I am looking forward to incorporating your input into the study. Once I

283
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.420
Unice Harris: get the transcripts and

284
00:51:51.510 --> 00:52:20.340
Unice Harris: format everything, I will send you over a copy. If you want to respond within 3 days you can respond with any CHANGES you want to add, or if I've missed interpreted anything, if you don't want to CHANGE anything, you certainly don't have to respond, and I will move forward with the study. Thank you again. I am so honored to have you participate in my study, and I greatly appreciate your taking the time.

285
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:32.500
PARTICIPANT 2 I will again be in touch within the next few days or so. Give you a copy, and you let me know if you want a copy of the In study, so

286
00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:40.270
PARTICIPANT 2 I'm going to send you your signed

287
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.640
PARTICIPANT 2 copy of of the consent form.

288
00:52:46.810 --> 00:53:12.549
Unice Harris: Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate your taking the time, and I love what it is that you're doing. With your ORGANIZATION. I cannot wait to expose other PEOPLE to what you're doing. So let's stay connected on Linkedin, and be able to work together again, and some other capacity. I would love that. Thank you so much. This was really.

289
00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:19.879
PARTICIPANT 2 really excited. I haven't done something like this before, and to be able to speak

290
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:28.329
PARTICIPANT 2 on it in the space of DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION when I think I'm really green behind the ears. So II appreciate

291
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:50.959
PARTICIPANT 2 the opportunity to to hear these, to get these questions and answer these questions, to to just help me think like, Wow, no, you you do have something behind you with that, and absolutely you do. Thank you again. I will give you back some time in your day, and thank you again. Have a wonderful weekend. You do the same. Thank you, and take care all the best.

292
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.930
PARTICIPANT 2 Bye-bye.


PARTICIPANT 3 TRANSCRIPTS


1
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.209
PARTICIPANT 3Hello! Yes. How are you?

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:48.759
Unice Harris: no problem at all. Thank you for joining. I was just checking your messages to see if you had left me a message of another time.

5
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.130
PARTICIPANT 3No, no, I'm good. I'm good for today.

6
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.869
Unice Harris: So everything worked out yesterday, yeah, we have hot water. So everything is great

7
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:23.099
Unice Harris: the wife is happy. So I'm happy, right. Good, good, good. Well, let me. I'll go ahead and jump into the questions, and then I will turn the recording off, and we can catch up, because, man, I know. You have some amazing stories, and I know that your family's thriving. Has your garden graduated Harvard yet.

8
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.550
Unice Harris: Yeah, she's graduated, and she's living in Dublin, Ireland. So

9
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.060
PARTICIPANT 3yeah.

10
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:50.659
PARTICIPANT 3she's long g10, my gosh, that is amazing! Oh, my goodness, that's amazing! We can catch up. We can catch up after the call.

11
00:11:50.830 --> 00:12:02.930
PARTICIPANT 3Oh, it's about that. About 1010 years, I would think, what is it? 2,000? Yeah, it's been a long time. It's been a while

12
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:30.329
Unice Harris: joining, and I know your schedule is busy, so I'll dive right in. This is the PURPOSE. Study again is to understand a little bit more about DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs and how CHANGE MAANAGEMENT can help to impact the the TRANSFORMATION and help to increase revenue. So I'll dive right into question number one,

13
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:43.430
Unice Harris: or other phase or start of the PROJECT. Can you share time when you communicated the PURPOSE of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION, and how it would enhance or help

14
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:54.569
Unice Harris: the ORGANIZATION. So just a time where, when you started the TRANSFORMATION, you were able to communicate the PURPOSE of the PROJECT and how it would help the ORGANIZATION.

15
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.680
PARTICIPANT 3Okay,

16
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:05.180
PARTICIPANT 3okay, I could think of a I'm thinking of one of the the deals that I've worked on

17
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:11.959
PARTICIPANT 3well, usually, before I communicate what the the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION is.

18
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:24.369
PARTICIPANT 3I have to sit down with the STAKEHOLDERS. I have like this pre COMMUNICATION MEETING to set it up so that it's not the first time hearing the PURPOSE of what's what's about to happen.

19
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:37.070
PARTICIPANT 3And so I walk through a II get with the sponsor. I usually I'll sit with the sponsor and find out. You know who are the different STAKEHOLDERS that are impacted by the TRANSFORMATION.

20
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:43.610
PARTICIPANT 3And then I once I identify who they are. I

21
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.430
II

22
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:54.619
PARTICIPANT 3talk to each one of them. So II kind of shop the the whole idea of the TRANSFORMATION around to each of the STAKEHOLDERS.

23
00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:03.050
PARTICIPANT 3And before I shop it around to them. I try to identify, you know. who are the ones who are the decision makers?

24
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:20.639
PARTICIPANT 3Who's the CHAMPIONs of what's about to happen. You know, who are the derailers who who's against it? Because usually you have different types of STAKEHOLDERS out there, and and I need to know who is who. So I know. I know how to manage them, not throughout the TRANSFORMATION.

25
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:37.049
PARTICIPANT 3So once once I do that, and I categorize them into like financial decision makers, or or CHAMPIONs, or derailers or influencers. Then I move into the PROCESS of giving

26
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:51.110
PARTICIPANT 3you know. Well, moving to the PROCESS of giving my COMMUNICATION speech or my kickoff speech to do the STAKEHOLDERS and anyone else that's

27
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.309
PARTICIPANT 3involved or being impacted by the TRANSFORMATION.

28
00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:07.890
PARTICIPANT 3So part of that TRANSFORMATION talk or kick off MEETING is II go through an overview of the the program, you know, and I talk about the scope of work.

29
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.889
PARTICIPANT 3And you know, for for this particular

30
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.609
PARTICIPANT 3well, phones ringing. But the particular

31
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:43.139
PARTICIPANT 3TRANSFORMATION I'm thinking about now is the CLOUD TRANSFORMATION. So the scope of work was moving the applications to the CLOUD. There was a I talked about the scope of work, the SUCCESS criteria, you know, and which was more, the apps needed to be operational. They need to meet sla criteria and they wanted a cost reduction in in this movement of the application.

32
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.629
PARTICIPANT 3And then I talk about the adding principles and the SUCCESS factors.

33
00:15:49.690 --> 00:16:04.350
PARTICIPANT 3that would be involved in in the particular program. Then I walked them through the road map of how we're gonna get there, you know. The planning the architecture design of what we're doing. You know we were

34
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:20.750
PARTICIPANT 3that you know the planning phase involved. You know us identifying what the goals and objectives were for the particular TRANSFORMATION and architecture design was, you know, they were going with a a hybrid CLOUD, and and then the migration execution, which was

35
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.190
PARTICIPANT 3more of a

36
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:32.849
PARTICIPANT 3re hosting. We were re hosting. It was that, like a lift and shift as opposed to, we were going to CHANGE what they had at that particular time.

37
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:45.300
PARTICIPANT 3You know. Later on they went into updating what they had, you know, and but they were NEW to it so initially. They just wanted to. You know, move to the CLOUD.

38
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.650
PARTICIPANT 3Then I talked about how would be govern, you know how we would measure

39
00:16:50.780 --> 00:17:16.969
PARTICIPANT 3what we were doing, and then and then talked about how we would get with them to afterwards. To find out, you know, what they thought of the particular on TRANSFORMATION. Was it smooth, while what were the issues that we had? So we would do SURVEYs at at the end. So I told them all about. That's that's how we're gonna approach it, how we're gonna manage it, you know. And then

40
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:27.420
PARTICIPANT 3let's see what else that I would do during that that talk I would. I talk about the program structure of the the

41
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:54.109
PARTICIPANT 3TRANSFORMATION, you know. Who is, who how is gonna be led, you know. again, I would talk a little more about the objectives. I would talk about the design and architecture a little more. And then the migration, how we're gonna do the migration, you know, waves, are we gonna do waves or and so and then what apps? We're gonna be migrated.

42
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:58.950
PARTICIPANT 3So all of that would happen during that initial MEETING.

43
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:05.910
Unice Harris: Got it? Do you feel like that? Minimize the confusion and potential chaos at the start.

44
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:12.399
PARTICIPANT 3It. It definitely does cause there's a lot of questions that come up during that

45
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:36.360
PARTICIPANT 3during that COMMUNICATION and and the PEOPLE that I had categorizes, you know. CHAMPIONs were, you know, heads for going up and down, and the the naysayers were like Oh, no! And I kNEW what, based on the conversation I have with them. Prior to this COMMUNICATION, I kNEW what were there. Hot buttons were.

46
00:18:36.360 --> 00:19:04.509
PARTICIPANT 3and once I kNEW the hot buttons, I made sure I covered that and and and talked about how we would mitigate some of the the risk that they thought were involved in in the TRANSFORMATION. So it was definitely helpful. Because it you you you can smooth everything out before you kick this thing off, and you answer a lot of the questions that the the naysayers have, and and then the CHAMPIONs, or they feel comfortable. If you can communicate what you're about to do.

47
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.620
PARTICIPANT 3They feel comfortable that they made the right decision.

48
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:19.960
PARTICIPANT 3So yeah, it was. It's very helpful to have that COMMUNICATION. We also talk about how the CHANGE is gonna happen. And and a lot of that is that's the most important is the CHANGE, you know.

49
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:30.900
PARTICIPANT 3is a major CHANGE. It's gonna happen throughout this TRANSFORMATION. It's gonna CHANGE, especially when you do a CLOUD migration. It's gonna CHANGE the culture of how you go about

50
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:39.190
PARTICIPANT 3doing things in the it and it, and even the business PEOPLE how they go about access accessing these applications.

51
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:57.319
PARTICIPANT 3It talks about. I talked about you know the how they how they would work work with the it DEPARTMENT, how? The it had a little more authority to do things because you could send up

52
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:20.940
PARTICIPANT 3and up servers and spend them down based on costs, so you can manage your costs a little better. There was a whole different mindset that the the ORGANIZATION needed to have so CHANGE MAANAGEMENT was very key to the whole TRANSFORMATION. And so II would spend time talking about the CHANGE and and how TRAINING needed to be done, and upscaling need to be done

53
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:31.259
PARTICIPANT 3for for some of the PEOPLE, and just a whole different mindset that they needed to have, and how that their MAANAGEMENT would would SUPPORT them on that. And so that was very key.

54
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:59.650
PARTICIPANT 3and if you don't, if you don't go through that part of it, the CHANGE part of it, you know you have your plan and everything. But if if you don't manage to CHANGE effectively, then they they TRANSFORMATIONs, not gonna work. Very interesting experience. And I kNEW you would have those kind of experiences. You've always been very meticulous in terms of your work.

55
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:14.620
Unice Harris: Presentation. And so that that is key and very significant you may not have any experience with this one, but can you share a time when you did not communicate the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION?

56
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:35.900
PARTICIPANT 3Actually, I've you know, that was based in Ibm. It was always required, you know, and I was at Ibm forever. So we always had to have a kicked off MEETING, and we had to communicate what we were about to do. That was one of the first steps in in PROJECT MAANAGEMENT was that kicked off MEETING.

57
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:54.360
PARTICIPANT 3so we we never I. There were times that I took over the PROJECT for someone else, and the COMMUNICATION had not been done properly right, and I had to go back and say, Oh, wait a minute. Don't even know what's going on here. We probably need to level set again, but usually.

58
00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:03.050
PARTICIPANT 3We. It was just it was required. It was a box that we need to check off before we kicked off any type of transition or TRANSFORMATION.

59
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:24.860
Unice Harris: Okay, Gotcha, question number 2, during the requirements for other phase of the TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you inform cross functional TEAMS or the ORGANIZATION as a whole, of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically, and how it would affect or impact or enhance, how they do their work

60
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.250
Unice Harris: from a day to day.

61
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:56.569
PARTICIPANT 3Okay, from a day to day and cross functionally, II guess. During the requirements grabbing phase, I would again. That was part of me talking with the STAKEHOLDERS that I mentioned earlier, so I would talk to the STAKEHOLDERS, find out who were the subject matter. Experts on their TEAM. These are PEOPLE that gonna help us with the implementation. PEOPLE that would be impacted by the TRANSFORMATION.

62
00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:13.100
PARTICIPANT 3I would and it wouldn't be me. It would be my TEAM would go in and meet with like this. I'll go back to the a previous example. They would meet with the application. Subject matter, experts, and

63
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:29.580
PARTICIPANT 3we would identify the applications that were being migrated. You know how critical those applications were, and all that INFORMATION would be brought back to me and then documented. And and once it's all documented, I would

64
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.670
PARTICIPANT 3go to the different

65
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:55.130
PARTICIPANT 3TEAMS or ORGANIZATIONs that were going to be affected by this TRANSFORMATION and talk about the applications that were going to be migrated up. You know how the dependencies that were attached to these applications, and how we were going to make sure that we didn't break any of those dependencies, or address those dependencies.

66
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:20.120
PARTICIPANT 3throughout the migration. So there was a another MEETING that needed to happen during the requirements. After we had sized what we were about to do. We needed to meet with the different ORGANIZATIONs that were impacted, and it was similar to like the Kickoff MEETING. Where, you know some of the questions that will come up on how we're gonna do it? Who is gonna be affected, you know.

67
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:31.089
PARTICIPANT 3if we know about the dependencies between these, the applications, these different applications. And so it was. It was very similar to the kickoff MEETING.

68
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:43.399
PARTICIPANT 3And you know, those same PEOPLE would show up at the kickoff MEETING to hear about what was going on. But there was like this pre-

69
00:24:43.960 --> 00:25:02.120
PARTICIPANT 3MEETING that happened prior to that MEETING where STAKEHOLDERS impacted, ORGANIZATIONs will be pulled in, and you had to have that conversation with them also. Because again, you need everyone on board during the TRANSFORMATION. But and they need to be that one thing that I always

70
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:23.229
PARTICIPANT 3preaches COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION. That's the key to winning on on a TRANSFORMATION or or any PROJECT is you've got. You need to communicate what you're about to do. And when PEOPLE like they don't know what's about to happen, and that's when you start running into problems. And so you there were many MEETINGS that would happen.

71
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:37.639
PARTICIPANT 3During that TRANSFORMATION, some prior to the kickoff, some during the kickoff. And then there's of course, there's status MEETINGS and everything that happened throughout the the TRANSFORMATION. And and and you really need to know

72
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:51.850
PARTICIPANT 3how to organize those MEETINGS? Who are the players that need to be there? And how do they want to see the INFORMATION that you're providing? And that's for some of the status MEETINGS that happen throughout, and sometimes those those

73
00:25:51.880 --> 00:26:17.910
Unice Harris: the format of those presentations CHANGE based on your audience and and based on the input that they give that I don't understand what you're telling me. You know they'll they'll state that. And you'll say, Okay, I need to. I need to spend this a different way where they understand what's going on right? Right? Exactly. That's great INFORMATION. And the way that you're approaching that that leads to TRANSFORMATION and CHANGE without trauma.

74
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:36.110
Unice Harris: Yeah, because on the back end of that PEOPLE, they do. They literally experience trauma because they're so used to doing what you're doing. And you know they they have these situations where NEW

75
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:56.369
Unice Harris: applications are rolled out, and they don't know anything about them. Just jump in here quickly that you were very good at communicating that. I remember that on the Belt Airlines account, and that was what was so impressive

76
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:10.599
PARTICIPANT 3when we pulled you in that you were very good at communicating upfront what was about to happen? And we went through a lot of PEOPLE before we got to you and it. It was obvious that you kNEW what you were doing. So

77
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:37.630
PARTICIPANT 3thank you. Thank you. I've been at it for a long time. Design, phase, or any other phase before development or

78
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:49.950
Unice Harris: life cycle. Can you share how you provided TRAINING relative to the PROCESS TECHNOLOGY or the NEW TRANSFORMATION initiative. Or if you didn't provide any TRAINING at all.

79
00:27:50.350 --> 00:28:01.719
PARTICIPANT 3We usually like for a CLOUD TRANSFORMATION, we we do have to provide TRAINING. And so the first thing we do is we look at their their, the

80
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:09.100
PARTICIPANT 3the needs. You know what type of TRAINING is necessary for the PEOPLE. So we look at the resources that they have within their ORGANIZATION

81
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:26.010
PARTICIPANT 3and and we find out, you know what levels they are and and then we identify TRAINING. And you know, with Microsoft, we have workshops. That we've already built in, because we know that a lot of companies are not

82
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:32.360
PARTICIPANT 3up to speed on the on CLOUD. So we have workshops that we provide

83
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:56.559
PARTICIPANT 3prior to the migration starting. And then throughout the migration there's there's different TRAININGs that we provide, and they're the workshops where we we bring in engineers to talk them through. You know what is the CLOUD, and how do you manage the costs in the CLOUD? And how do you set up the right for the CLOUD and

84
00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:15.310
PARTICIPANT 3and and different things like that. So we we get them up to speed, get them comfortable. That's part of the cultural CHANGE that happens also cause that TRAINING is key to it. Where they they become comfortable with the NEW environment that they're working in and the rules and how to engage in that NEW environment. So

85
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:22.760
PARTICIPANT 3there's hands on on TRAINING with labs on summer lectures.

86
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:41.089
PARTICIPANT 3we also try to get them to certify. And we have programs where we entice them to certify. We may pay for, you know, 50 of the cost of the certification exam, and one time we paid 100. But over time, as as PEOPLE

87
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:58.349
PARTICIPANT 3start becoming more custom to the CLOUD, we'll we'll probably we'll play for 50% of what it would take. So there's we would we? We do customize TRAINING if necessary. We have this standard TRAINING. And then there's also certification.

88
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:04.650
PARTICIPANT 3TRAINING and preparation, so they can certify. So they they feel like they're

89
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.990
PARTICIPANT 3They are competent and and performing the task that they they need to perform

90
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:36.270
Unice Harris: good INFORMATION. Thank you. Question number 4, in the TESTING phase of the TRANSFORMATION life cycle. Can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS. Maybe a user acceptance test to confirm that it works the way it should or some other type of TESTING

91
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.990
PARTICIPANT 3during the TESTING phase, we usually did user acceptance test TESTING. But there was also

92
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:56.140
PARTICIPANT 3 we did TESTING throughout the TRANSFORMATION. first, we would before the TRANSFORMATION, we would do a performance TESTING.

93
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:15.550
PARTICIPANT 3That's before the migration. Just to get a baseline on. Okay, what? What you have prior to us. Doing the migration. We will do functional TESTING at the end to make sure that every it's working the way that we thought it was supposed to work.

94
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:26.259
PARTICIPANT 3And that's us doing TESTING. And then there's some user TESTING, except this TESTING, which is where the end users are TESTING it and telling us, Yeah, this is how this is just as

95
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:31.160
PARTICIPANT 3efficient as it was before as it is is more efficient. We can get the application

96
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:59.529
PARTICIPANT 3faster. There's no way. We can get to our data. So there's a lot of TESTING. That happens, we'll even do like load TESTING and stress TESTING throughout. Just so that we make sure that the customer is getting what was expected, or or we we try to exceed their expectations. But there's much TESTING that goes on throughout

97
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.870
PARTICIPANT 3before, during and after

98
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:25.640
PARTICIPANT 3good. And do you feel like sometimes, or or did you experience that sometimes, after you tested, you had to go back and make some additional modifications before. It was rolled out into production. Oh, definitely, definitely, it doesn't always work like we expected it to work, and so when we find those, it may, you know it does affect the timeline somewhat.

99
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:31.620
PARTICIPANT 3Because that's a a setback. We'll we'll try to make it up.

100
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.110
PARTICIPANT 3You know, work on the weekend to correct what? What was

101
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:58.080
PARTICIPANT 3Causing the issue? And then we we drive on. But yeah, there's there's never perfect there's always something that's wrong. It could be something minor and something, major. But there's always something that may may go wrong. And and then we correct that, you know, like there's a dependency that we were. We didn't

102
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:07.180
PARTICIPANT 3identify during the upfront, and then we find out, oh, man, I didn't know this application was affected by this.

103
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:28.760
PARTICIPANT 3and now, what we need to go back and correct that or this, this application will not be migrated. We have to leave it. And then there's another MEETING that happens so like I said, the COMMUNICATION that happens. But we have to go back to the STAKEHOLDERS and said, and tell them that we didn't take into account. This we missed it, and so we'll have to leave this

104
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:39.249
PARTICIPANT 3on Prem until we can come up with a solution to move it to migrate it over. Or maybe we'll replace this application completely with something different. If

105
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:50.410
PARTICIPANT 3with your approval. Right? So. But it's lots of TESTING. And still we're back to COMMUNICATION, which I say COMMUNICATION is key, and it happens throughout

106
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:56.190
Unice Harris: perfect. Thank you. Were there any times where you didn't do any TESTING?

107
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.020
PARTICIPANT 3 I've

108
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.420
PARTICIPANT 3and

109
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.410
Unice Harris: them have to be?

110
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:19.620
PARTICIPANT 3Now I'm trying to think of. Are there any like on other type PROJECTs? I've had other type PROJECTs that maybe I have. I've missed. It was TESTING was probably done it just probably wasn't as thorough as it needed to be

111
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:30.380
PARTICIPANT 3which caused problems in the end. II know of one. I think I I'll talk about that one later where I didn't ask the right questions, upfront

112
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:35.820
PARTICIPANT 3and and there was some TESTING or some modifications that needed to be done

113
00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:52.140
PARTICIPANT 3to make the PROJECT SUCCESSFUL, and I found out the day before the TRANSFORMATION was supposed to start, that we were not ready, and it delayed everything. I mean. It shifted everything by a couple of weeks

114
00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:56.350
PARTICIPANT 3before we could start, which made the customer very unhappy.

115
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.709
PARTICIPANT 3and that was that was a miss.

116
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.449
Unice Harris: I'll bet I'll bet. And and how did you manage that?

117
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:26.620
PARTICIPANT 3Very good question. So I I had a sleepless night because I was trying to decide. Well, do I tell them, or do I just move forward, and then I try to correct it down the road. And I've I talked to my MAANAGEMENT about it. And and we decided, Yeah, you need to tell them upfront. And then you need to tell them that it's gonna be delayed.

118
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:38.939
PARTICIPANT 3And so I did. And I, you know I took the blows and they were very unhappy. They later on. They said they appreciated the fact that I told them

119
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:52.510
PARTICIPANT 3upfront, but still it didn't clear me of anything. I should have been prepared. I should have known but it was probably the right thing to do. You know, some PEOPLE would have gone. Drew, you know.

120
00:35:53.060 --> 00:36:13.639
PARTICIPANT 3started the PROJECT and then came up with some other excuse that? Oh, yeah, yeah, we're gonna delay this because of this. But it was best to get that all straighten out prior to kicking off the TRANSFORMATION. And then, after that everything was smooth, right, but that it needed to be done, that that particular task needed to be done.

121
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.780
PARTICIPANT 3that that is amazing, that you were able to apply integrity to that whole PROCESS, and then just

122
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.190
Unice Harris: move it forward that way.

123
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:33.290
PARTICIPANT 3Yes, and and for that particular PROJECT we already had had issues. I had replaced someone who had done such a terrible job.

124
00:36:33.290 --> 00:37:02.709
PARTICIPANT 3And so I came in to replace that person, and then then I missed that point. I was like, oh, so now I go back with, Oh, yeah, I missed this. And so that's why I was like a sleepless night. How do I handle this, you know, and you know that the right thing, instead of you know what I thought would, you know, make me not look as bad, or make the company not look as bad. I did the right thing. So II if I had to do it all over again, I would do it to say.

125
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:20.909
Unice Harris: and those integrity goes a long way. After the rollout into production. How are end users, employees, and STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback relative to what worked in production and what were what seem not to work smoothly.

126
00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:36.719
PARTICIPANT 3We had SURVEYs part of our TRANSFORMATION PROCESS, and that started at Ibm, and and they do it. A great deal at Microsoft is. There's SURVEYs and questionnaires that are sent out.

127
00:37:36.720 --> 00:38:01.409
PARTICIPANT 3They're sent out after like the kickoff. What do you think about what's about to happen? Blah blah blah! And then at the end, there's SURVEYs that that are sent out to the employees and to the STAKEHOLDERS to get to get feedback right on. You know. What do you think? Just half about this TRANSFORMATION that just happened? And where could where could we have done things better.

128
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:23.440
PARTICIPANT 3What is some of your complaints? So? And then, once we're into the the post migration, we're constantly, periodically sending out SURVEYs. How are we doing? How are we doing? Because we want more business right? And so we want to make sure that we're doing it right. And if any of the INFORMATION we correct collect.

129
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:35.599
PARTICIPANT 3we correct what they say is a problem right? And we would meet with them if necessary. If it's something that they really feel strongly about, and it's it's having a

130
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:45.870
PARTICIPANT 3they're having Major angst over it. Then we'd set up a MEETING and sit down and talk to them about it. Find out, okay, what? What can we do to help you here?

131
00:38:46.080 --> 00:39:01.440
Unice Harris: Perfect. So after you rolled the SYSTEM or the solutions out into production, and received the feedback of the STAKEHOLDERS and customers. Did it eventually increase revenue.

132
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:18.060
PARTICIPANT 3Well, I would say yes, because if we're doing a good job. Then that means we're getting more business from them. Right? If we're doing a good job, that means. And as far as the CLOUD is concerned. If we're doing a good job, that means they're gonna use

133
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:31.680
PARTICIPANT 3more work. They're gonna put more workload on the CLOUD and the more workload they put on the CLOUD, the more money is generated, more REVENUEis generated. So yes, if we can keep them happy.

134
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.369
PARTICIPANT 3And I probably learned this at

135
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:53.520
PARTICIPANT 3Ibm is the the happier you keep those end users the more they use your product. Right? And so this is. This is very key to to generating more revenue. You need to know what they think, what they think about your product. And you need to need to make corrections.

136
00:39:53.630 --> 00:40:01.580
PARTICIPANT 3And and once you make those corrections and make them happy, then they use your product more, and you can. It generates more revenue.

137
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.040
Unice Harris: awesome.

138
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:10.090
Unice Harris: Oh, boy, you need to be an instructor somewhere.

139
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:26.279
PARTICIPANT 3That's my next job.

140
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.529
PARTICIPANT 3Yeah. PROJECT MAANAGEMENT

141
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.190
Unice Harris: cause you know, a lot of times.

142
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:38.949
Unice Harris: although those technologies are

143
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:46.739
Unice Harris: supposed to generate REVENUEbecause of the way that they're implemented. They end up losing revenue

144
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:51.659
Unice Harris: and go figure. I don't know how that works. But

145
00:40:51.720 --> 00:41:19.469
Unice Harris: you know sometimes from the start to the finish, clients are so frustrated with how they do things that they just end up losing REVENUEas opposed to generating revenue, because, you know, they've not built in the COMMUNICATION. They've not trained their end users. And so they roll it out into production. And PEOPLE don't know what it is. It's like, what are we supposed to do?

146
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.700
PARTICIPANT 3Yes.

147
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:30.089
PARTICIPANT 3you know, you'd be surprised how often that happens. So yeah, you definitely gotta get to a university.

148
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:48.830
Unice Harris: Is it on my bucket list? Yeah. Question number 6, can you share an example of a DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION that went very well. You've already done that also one that didn't go very well. What did you do differently between the 2?

149
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.209
PARTICIPANT 3Okay, let's see one that

150
00:41:54.140 --> 00:42:03.569
PARTICIPANT 3didn't go. Well, okay, that the one remember II brought up the one that did not go well. And II have. You know there's an one that

151
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:12.000
PARTICIPANT 3did go well. It. It was a mining company that I was working with, and this was at

152
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:18.220
PARTICIPANT 3Ibm, and I went through my PROCESS of identifying the STAKEHOLDERS.

153
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:22.860
PARTICIPANT 3And what category they they fell in. And

154
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:40.280
PARTICIPANT 3There were 2 important STAKEHOLDERS, and one was, and they were added 2 different geographies. One was out of the Us. And one was out of South America, and they both had They were executives, so they had a lot of clout, and one was a derailer, and he thought that the whole PROJECT was a waste of time.

155
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:54.990
PARTICIPANT 3and that was the one out of the Us. And the one out of the South America was the one who had the the purse strings, and he was the CHAMPION towards this PROJECT, but the one in the Us. Was the one that I had to work with.

156
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:59.019
PARTICIPANT 3so my task was to keep the PROJECT on track

157
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.879
PARTICIPANT 3to align the 2 STAKEHOLDERS and then make sure that that

158
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:13.339
PARTICIPANT 3the plan activities were well managed, so that left little room for for for that derailer to step in there and disrupt

159
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:19.060
PARTICIPANT 3 So I kept the unSUPPORTed STAKEHOLDER

160
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:35.989
PARTICIPANT 3and his focus his, his TEAM briefed on all scheduled CHANGES within the environment, so that CHANGE MAANAGEMENT was very key, managing the CHANGES that were going on and then communicating those CHANGES to the unSUPPORTed STAKEHOLDER.

161
00:43:35.990 --> 00:44:00.260
PARTICIPANT 3And anything that looked like it was going around a practice to alert the client, you know, prior to that event happening, you know, if a CHANGE is about to happen. I made sure they kNEW that the CHANGE was going to happen one week prior to that. To that CHANGE happening I always communicated that to them, or if I ran into a issue, I didn't hold it. I would

162
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:09.989
PARTICIPANT 3report that issue very early on, so that it it wasn't a II told you so. Moment with the non SUPPORTive STAKEHOLDER.

163
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:30.329
PARTICIPANT 3 and then II made it a point to keep the SUPPORT of STAKEHOLDER informed of all the activities. Right? The guy out of South America, you know what was going on. How I was handling, and he kNEW the other person was a derailer, how I was handling that particular person, and so

164
00:44:30.390 --> 00:45:00.350
PARTICIPANT 3I had to manage both STAKEHOLDERS and and and that happened throughout. And then the results. It was it was SUCCESSFUL. The the 10 TRANSFORMATION was SUCCESSFUL. I had very little hiccups, I mean, I had uncomfortable conversations sometimes with the the one STAKEHOLDER. That was a derailer, but I was able to answer all of his questions and and satisfy him along the way, so he didn't make it easy for me.

165
00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:17.909
PARTICIPANT 3but he was well informed. He kNEW about the CHANGES, the CHANGES were managed, and and then at the end it was SUCCESSFUL. So I got a you know. Good reading from both, which was surprising. Even you know it was. But it it was it. It didn't disrupt our business

166
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:27.090
PARTICIPANT 3now that was a good one. Now the bad one is the one that I brought up before. And it was

167
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:41.639
PARTICIPANT 3I was the what was the? It was a financial TRANSFORMATION finance SYSTEM. And they business PROCESSES and their Erp SYSTEM were going to be moved to an Ibm solution.

168
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.950
PARTICIPANT 3So

169
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:51.879
PARTICIPANT 3 I had a a 12 business PROCESS.

170
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:58.529
PARTICIPANT 3architects, or what were they called? You know, business business PROCESS analyst.

171
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:12.770
PARTICIPANT 3were being managed on this particular PROJECT, and then I had the sap TEAM. But the sap TEAM was a vendor right? And so I had to manage the vendor. The 12

172
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:32.820
PARTICIPANT 3business PROCESS PEOPLE were I Ibmers and the the sap configuration TEAM were were vendors, and so a day before. Go live, I was informed there was an issue with the sap set up, and I just the the problem there was. I did not manage my vendor properly.

173
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:58.590
PARTICIPANT 3I just assumed they kNEW what they were doing, and wherever they reported me I believe I didn't. I didn't verify, and that was a that was a problem. So, and that vendor was there like I said, someone else is running that TRANSFORMATION prior to me getting there. And they were doing it a a terrible job. And then I was moved in and I was moved in closer to the start date and I just

174
00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:59.890
PARTICIPANT 3Hello!

175
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:07.230
PARTICIPANT 3What happened was There was they. There wasn't a proper segregation of duties within, Sab.

176
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.290
PARTICIPANT 3and so

177
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:32.279
PARTICIPANT 3hold it out. Then it was wide open. It was a security issue. PEOPLE could do, you know, approve things us submit and then approve on their own. So that was gonna be a major problem. So we got through with the TRANSFORMATION. It says, Oh, yeah, we're done. And that whole was there. And it was gonna cause our kind of problems. So

178
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:39.049
PARTICIPANT 3the what I had to do was I had to go to the to the the STAKEHOLDERS and tell them that.

179
00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:52.120
PARTICIPANT 3We're gonna have to delay this for about a week cause we need to go through and and check their sap SYSTEM and look at the segregation of duties. Make sure that everybody's in the proper slots.

180
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.169
PARTICIPANT 3and so we delayed the go live

181
00:47:55.310 --> 00:48:08.710
PARTICIPANT 3 So I just had to absorb the hit. And Ibm had absorbed additional costs because they that meant that they were gonna be resources that were going to be moved off

182
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:13.370
PARTICIPANT 3of of that particular

183
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:26.109
PARTICIPANT 3PROCESS, that financial ORGANIZATION, and with the better PROCESSES and the NEW sap SYSTEM that we're going to move these PEOPLE into other jobs and lay them off. But because

184
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:31.639
PARTICIPANT 3we laid it for a couple of weeks. They they had that

185
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:45.880
PARTICIPANT 3maintain those PEOPLE for a couple of weeks, which mean that was a cost. And so we absorbed the cost for them. So that was another hit on on that one. So what I learned from that is always check and verify, check and verify

186
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.450
PARTICIPANT 3throughout your TRANSFORMATION. Don't accept

187
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:57.860
PARTICIPANT 3someone's word for it. That oh, yeah, they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. If it's critical through the SUCCESS of your TRANSFORMATION that can verify

188
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:07.410
Unice Harris: good, awesome. Okay, I like that. And the the good thing about that.

189
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:11.399
Unice Harris: there there again, the application of integrity

190
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:40.080
PARTICIPANT 3allow you to do the right thing where that was concerned and still overcome. That that that big issue. So yes, yes, and and it was a you know, I always, even when there's something that goes wrong, you should be able to learn from it. And so II you know every time if I run into an issue where it? It looks so gloomy, you know. If you got lemons you gotta make lemonade. I'll figure out, okay. What did I learn from

191
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:50.550
PARTICIPANT 3what? What can I take from that that I can as a positive, so I can move forward with it. I just know, you know. Talk over and say, well, with me, it's like, Okay.

192
00:49:50.570 --> 00:50:04.400
PARTICIPANT 3that was bad. But there's something I could learn from that, and I will fix it the next time. And you know I'm I make sure that I'm SUCCESSFUL. At the end of whatever was going on in that TRANSFORMATION. Yeah, I was pushed off

193
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:14.350
PARTICIPANT 3off of target. Miss, I missed a milestone, my timeline but I corrected it, and and that won't happen again. I learned from that. So

194
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:28.549
PARTICIPANT 3I always bring this one up. Even when I was like interviewing I was leaving. Ibm. I always bought this one up because it was something that I learned from, and it it hasn't happened to me since.

195
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.300
Unice Harris: Wow! That's amazing. Thank you for sharing that

196
00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:46.600
Unice Harris: and I think you answer. You've already answered question number 8, after the rollout into production. How did the TRANSFORMATION give you or the employees and STAKEHOLDERS the results that were expected?

197
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.179
Unice Harris: I think you answered that

198
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:54.810
Unice Harris: with the CLOUD TRANSFORMATION, because you mentioned that

199
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.789
Unice Harris: you know they used

200
00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:10.929
Unice Harris: more and then that INCREASED REVENUEper se from my standpoint. But on the on the other side it's

201
00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:19.530
PARTICIPANT 3I know, SUCCESSFUL. If I achieve the objective. If I hit the milestones, you know, from a TRANSFORMATION standpoint.

202
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.609
PARTICIPANT 3Was I within budget?

203
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:43.250
PARTICIPANT 3Then, something that's a little subjective. How was the TEAM that deployed it? Were they satisfied with what the results? And then that SURVEY for the customer. Find out if they're satisfied, and then the quality it was the quality of the work done. Did it meet the customers? Expect expectations that exceed the expectation.

204
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:55.180
PARTICIPANT 3So I look at all of those and say, Okay, I was SUCCESSFUL. If I, if I hit the objectives and the milestones in the budget, and the customer satisfied, and then the quality is there and is is considered a SUCCESS

205
00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.359
PARTICIPANT 3perfect. Can you share an activity

206
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:10.980
Unice Harris: that you, took to create a DIGITAL innovation mindset within the entire ORGANIZATION.

207
00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:16.330
PARTICIPANT 3That that goes back to the TRAINING and the workshops.

208
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.170
And the the TRAINING that happens prior to

209
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:30.790
PARTICIPANT 3 the TRANSFORMATION during the TRANSFORMATION after TRANSFORMATION. There is a cultural CHANGE that has to happen, especially when you're doing CLOUD

210
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:44.760
PARTICIPANT 3migration of CLOUD taking a customer on a CLOUD journey. They have to re envision how they go about doing things and where they're getting

211
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:57.060
PARTICIPANT 3like their applications. From where do they place their workload? Who has the authority to to like? If let's say they're building an application?

212
00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:06.599
PARTICIPANT 3They need to be trained on, and and devops that you know, you can spin up a test environment, test your application and spin it down.

213
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:29.539
PARTICIPANT 3whereas, prior to going to the CLOUD. You have to go get servers. You have to get this test sandbox. You have all some the the infrastructure group and say, please, could you, you know, get the a server, and you give them gave them the specifications of the server that you needed, or whatever platform that you needed, you would give them the specifications. Then they would have to go.

214
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:53.169
PARTICIPANT 3They didn't have it, and which would delay your TESTING, or you would skip that TESTING and move on, and then maybe you would get what you needed near the end of rolling out that particular application, and then you find out, oh, wow! It doesn't work on on this type of platform. So we need to go back and make some CHANGES. So within the CLOUD environments like, no, you pick what you want.

215
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:55.300
PARTICIPANT 3you can set it up yourself.

216
00:53:55.340 --> 00:54:17.380
PARTICIPANT 3You could spin it up. You could test your application. Then you could spin it back down and then you have to teach them about managing costs, though there's a cost to spinning things up and running these things and and how is your how does your MAANAGEMENT govern that? Do they give you complete authority to do it? Or they give you a range of authority.

217
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:21.300
PARTICIPANT 3And so all of that happens during

218
00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:35.070
PARTICIPANT 3during the before, before and during the TRANSFORMATION where you're doing a cultural CHANGE. But the key to that cultural CHANGE. It has to start at the top, and that it's the leaders at the top that need to know

219
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:45.679
PARTICIPANT 3that this CHANGE is happening. They need to BUYINto the CHANGE as as happening, and then they need to let it blow boot down throughout their ORGANIZATION. So

220
00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:50.249
PARTICIPANT 3what I've seen is that some of these leaders

221
00:54:50.420 --> 00:55:13.730
PARTICIPANT 3feel like, you know, especially if you're a manager of a a group of it resources. And you hear this CLOUD coming. And PEOPLE are gonna manage a lot of the things that your PEOPLE used to manage. You feel like, Oh, I'm gonna lose some PEOPLE. And then you feel like, maybe they don't need me anymore. So you have to convince them that you're not gonna be lost. You have to have this CLOUD

222
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:18.560
PARTICIPANT 3first mentality. And

223
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:25.509
PARTICIPANT 3you have to embrace this this NEW innovative

224
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.350
PARTICIPANT 3platform that we're trying to sell you a way of doing business

225
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:54.139
PARTICIPANT 3and and get TRAINING that's necessary, and understand what's going on in the CLOUD and what's going on in your ORGANIZATION, and how to use your PEOPLE differently. You may, you know, sometimes you're gonna lose some PEOPLE, but a lot of times you keep the PEOPLE and you just have them doing more of the core business as opposed to those administrative pass that they were doing before.

226
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:56.200
PARTICIPANT 3And so

227
00:55:56.210 --> 00:56:20.679
PARTICIPANT 3it's it's a it's all part of the TRAINING. It's part of the CHANGE MAANAGEMENT, cultural CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. Which involves the TRAINING of the employees and then ex explaining them, explaining to them how their business PROCESSES will CHANGE. And so that happens more time than not. When you're doing a a CLOUD migration.

228
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:45.040
PARTICIPANT 3There's a lot that happens within that ORGANIZATION that you have to give them the the innovative mindset. And now to have artificial intelligence coming on board is, it's becoming even more key to get the proper TRAINING and the knowledge to the PEOPLE. Because you got the CLOUD and you got artificial intelligence, and you bring all that together. It's a major CHANGE. It CHANGES everything. So

229
00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:58.230
PARTICIPANT 3you know, you're talking about you're gonna be around about 12 years more. I was thinking, Okay, I'm gonna slow down. I'm gonna go do this and then wait a minute. This is interesting. This is a game CHANGEr.

230
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:03.339
PARTICIPANT 3And II wanna stick around a little longer to see where this goes because this

231
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:05.739
PARTICIPANT 3this is this is

232
00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:21.380
PARTICIPANT 3This is a pivotal moment in in it and and in everything, as I'm bringing this AI on and that. And so back to the TRANSFORMATION, we're trans, we TRANSFORM PEOPLE from on-prem to the CLOUD. Now, we got this artificial intelligence is, which is, gonna

233
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:26.590
PARTICIPANT 3do even more. And it was. It was logical that it happened.

234
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:39.869
PARTICIPANT 3It was logical happen, because once we started putting all that data out there in the world. And you got everything from, you know, the Internet to tick, tock to. There's all this intelligence that we just started creating.

235
00:57:39.900 --> 00:58:07.090
Unice Harris: that somebody figured out how to harness and turn it into this artificial intelligence. And then, now, we can use that data to do some some pretty incredible things. Yeah, I'm excited about it, too. I mean, there's the machine. Learning so many other facets of AI that PEOPLE are not even looking at yet and feel like it's exciting. But

236
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:17.409
Unice Harris: there has to be an ethical component, someone within every ORGANIZATION. This is a

237
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:31.330
Unice Harris: this was gonna lead us into a lawsuit. Better scale back in terms of that, because, literally with Jenner, today, you've got a discriminator and a genius

238
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:59.189
Unice Harris: that you know, they, the the discriminator and the generator. They just keep arguing, arguing back and forth until you get a perfect image, and somebody that takes something like a Picasso painting and runs it through that discriminator. And that generator they can produce images that look almost exactly like a multi 1 million dollar painting, and.

239
00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:12.360
Unice Harris: you know, distributed for the same price. So there has to be some ethics around that whole thing. You know, you can do that same thing with bank statements. You can do that same

240
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:23.289
Unice Harris: cancer or other disease diagnosis, you know. You know, you have to think in terms of medical innovation doctors that

241
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:50.670
PARTICIPANT 3don't have ethics and integrity. They, you know, they want to use those images to line their pockets. Those misdiagnoses. So it it it definitely is exciting. I. And a dark side to everything. So well, you know they're thinking about, or they're not even thinking about it. Some companies are hiring ethicists. AI, chief

242
00:59:50.790 --> 01:00:17.260
PARTICIPANT 3AI ethicis, and that's their job is to check the the products that are being developed, using AI and making sure that ethical making sure they don't have bias in that, because there's that's another issue that you run into. You could have someone who has bias against women and bias against minorities. And they build into their AI SYSTEM that bias right? And it's and and that AI SYSTEM is making decisions for the company.

243
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.570
PARTICIPANT 3A decision is about a product. And you know, women are saying, Whoa!

244
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:47.049
PARTICIPANT 3Why does this this not work for me? Or you know this is discriminating against me, or or minorities are saying it doesn't work for me right? And why is it? And it's. And they said, Well, I didn't do anything. This the computer, right? It's artificial intelligence. But man made that artificial intelligence. And if we built the bias into that artificial intelligence. Then we're you're still being discriminated against. So it's gonna be.

245
01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:59.039
Unice Harris: it's gonna be prevalent. I mean, things like CLOUD TECHNOLOGY. And AI. It's moving forward, whether we like it or not. To be proactive, to get ahead of it.

246
01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:03.430
Unice Harris: To see, you know, to to make certain that those

247
01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:17.540
Unice Harris: integrity use all the time is built into that. So so last question, can you share why, you think CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important or not important.

248
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:47.290
PARTICIPANT 3CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is very important. as I stated earlier, you have ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE when that's the PROCESSES and the tools that you're gonna use within the ORGANIZATION. You need to make sure that those you you manage that CHANGE. And then you have the cultural CHANGE where it's a a mindset, you know. Is it? Is it innovative mindset? Is how? What authority do you have to do things that you were doing? Are you now a decision maker at the lower level.

249
01:01:47.290 --> 01:02:05.709
PARTICIPANT 3Because of this cultural CHANGE that happened, you know, you might have more authority to do things as opposed to waiting for your boss to tell you what to do. Now you have more authority. You might be able to be a little more innovative on your own, and bring that and and push that

250
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:14.900
PARTICIPANT 3up to your superiors as opposed to them, pushing down ideas to you. So I think the cultural CHANGE.

251
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:26.229
PARTICIPANT 3And you know, the whole ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE that needs to happen within an ORGANIZATION when a TRANSFORMATION is happening. That's a key. And I've worked on

252
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:47.380
PARTICIPANT 3PROJECTs that we didn't have a CHANGE manager. And and if you don't have a CHANGE, manager, things will go awry. You need a CHANGE, manager, and I know within Ibm I worked on a couple of PROJECTs. I says, I need a CHANGE manager, and I'm like, it's not in the budget, you know we. We budget it for everything except the CHANGE manager. So you're it

253
01:02:47.420 --> 01:03:00.259
PARTICIPANT 3and at that point you have to come up with your own CHANGE MAANAGEMENT plan, and you have to manage it. Maybe you designate someone on your TEAM to to do it. But you need to make sure that you're involved in in designing that

254
01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:14.449
PARTICIPANT 3that how it's gonna be reported, what needs to be captured. And then you manage that CHANGE, because if you don't manage to CHANGE, things will go go awry. I mean you. You'll just run into all kind of problems. So CHANGE MAANAGEMENT.

255
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:15.990
PARTICIPANT 3COMMUNICATION.

256
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:27.330
PARTICIPANT 3Where CHANGE MAANAGEMENT falls underneath that within that. But COMMUNICATION is key. You gotta communicate, communicate, communicate. But you gotta manage. CHANGE and CHANGE is

257
01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:56.850
PARTICIPANT 3is happening throughout the TRANSFORMATION, and you gotta manage it from a cultural level to the tools and the PROCESSES. You have to manage that CHANGE to the attitude of the managers seeing the CHANGE happening. And they feel like they're losing control of their ORGANIZATION, and the things that they were very comfortable in doing. And from down the level of the PEOPLE doing the work that they see. You know different application. Way of you know. Am I still to do this?

258
01:03:56.930 --> 01:04:16.210
PARTICIPANT 3If if I'm not skilled to do it. Am I about to lose my job or CHANGE caused me to lose my job cause I'm I you know I'm no longer needed. You have to make them comfortable, and I remember one deal that I worked on where that was key to me. II had a MEETING with

259
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:38.070
PARTICIPANT 3the the PEOPLE that were being affected by the job. Their managers were invited, but III told them to send in their it staff. They came in, and then we talked about the things that was gonna happen, and II listened to all the questions. After that INFORMATION, reported it back their manager. Some of the managers showed up, some didn't

260
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.859
PARTICIPANT 3and then

261
01:04:40.060 --> 01:05:00.679
PARTICIPANT 3we worked in, making sure that CHANGE did not have a negative impact on on the PEOPLE. I mean some. It it did, some did get laid off because of the CHANGE, but for the most part we were able to manage that TRANSFORMATION much better because we were managing CHANGE. And so yes, CHANGE is very important.

262
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:14.360
Unice Harris: Thank you wonderful. Listen. I want to thank you for participating in this study. Your experience and education is invaluable. I will pull together.

263
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:38.260
PARTICIPANT 3The INFORMATION is, send it out to you. If you wanna CHANGE anything about your interview. Let me know within 3 days, and then I will get that CHANGE. And then also, if you want a copy of the study. I'll send you in study. I'll send you INFORMATION on how to get that. I'll send it over to you once it's done sound good.


PARTICIPANT 4


WEBVTT

1
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.620
Unice Harris: Good morning.

2
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.599
PARTICIPANT 4 Hi! Good morning.

3
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.549
Unice Harris: Hi, Sabi! How are you doing? Good? So we I have my video off

4
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.979
PARTICIPANT 4 cause I'll just be recording the audio and nothing else.

5
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.810
Unice Harris: and

6
00:03:37.820 --> 00:04:03.919
PARTICIPANT 4 thank you so much for participating in my study for my doctor's degree. I still appreciate you, and I noticed when you were doing conferences or luncheon learns a couple of years back, I'm thinking, wow, he has experience. Yeah. So your input and your feedback is invaluable to the study.

7
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:16.830
Unice Harris: So basically, the PURPOSE of the study is to talk through the BENEFITS of incorporating CHANGE MAANAGEMENT into DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.

8
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:44.819
Unice Harris: probably, as you know, many of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs are failing. Over the years. Probably more than 70% of them are failing. And I did a detailed study about that in this kind of you know, collecting data on that study. And if you want a copy of the final study. I will send that to you. Just shoot me an EMAIL. Let me know that you want a copy of it.

9
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.250
PARTICIPANT 4 And

10
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:59.750
Unice Harris: we'll go ahead and get started. Any questions that you have for me before we get started. I'll ask you 9 questions, and you just give me your honest feedback and we'll document it from there.

11
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:19.779
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah, no, thank you for that. I will definitely would love to. Get a copy of that on the study. Because, yeah, in my experiences, I've seen similar kind of challenges where multiple PROJECTs DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROJECTs are fairly failing.

12
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:36.170
PARTICIPANT 4 And ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is such a key piece in making sure that you know, those PROJECTs get delivered on time and provides at the end of the day provides that value. So I would love to. Get a copy of that.

13
00:05:36.170 --> 00:06:00.780
Unice Harris: That would be wonderful. And hopefully you can take that INFORMATION in the study and incorporate it into what you're doing, and then, you know, be a force in terms of helping PEOPLE within our industry. Turn that PROCESS around. You know, and minimize some of the failures. Going forward. So I'll go ahead and start with the questions. Question number one

14
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:14.930
Unice Harris: during the initiation or other phase or start of the PROJECT. Can you share a time when you communicated the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION, and how it would enhance or help

15
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.440
Unice Harris: the ORGANIZATION.

16
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.909
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah, definitely. So you know, one of the, you know, complex DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION which I did

17
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:39.429
PARTICIPANT 4 start started a PROJECT in 2,018, and it was a. It was a very different experience for me, because the PROJECT actually started in 2,008, and for 10 years had failed multiple times.

18
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:57.079
PARTICIPANT 4 So I was coming into a PROJECT which had a lot of this baggage so changing the PURPOSE of the PROJECT, and actually identifying and communicating the the.

19
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.179
PARTICIPANT 4 the, the.

20
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.470
Unice Harris: Are you still with me?

21
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.009
Unice Harris: Let's see me see if I can shut some.

22
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.789
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah, I'm here.

23
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.820
PARTICIPANT 4 The

24
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.760
can you hear me? Oh, wow!

25
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.659
Unice Harris: Sabi, are you still here?

26
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.669
Unice Harris: Okay, perfect. Thank you. So much for that. I apologize for that.

27
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:51.429
Unice Harris: The technical issue there. So let's just go ahead and jump right back in. You were telling me that you started a PROJECT in 2018, and the PROJECT actually had started in 2,008 and had failed multiple times

28
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.839
Unice Harris: and go ahead and continue from there.

29
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:08.569
PARTICIPANT 4 Thing was that it was very important to share the PURPOSE of the PROJECT, but coming into fail. PROJECT.

30
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:15.230
PARTICIPANT 4 the the PURPOSE. PEOPLE already know what the PURPOSE of the PROJECT is, so you need a little bit more.

31
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.020
PARTICIPANT 4 You have to

32
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:35.340
PARTICIPANT 4 do 2 things. One is, you should be very clear about your own why and your own PURPOSE. Why, you're doing that. And then the second is, you need to reframe the the story because PEOPLE have a negative connotation about that particular PROJECT. So how are we gonna reframe

33
00:10:35.500 --> 00:11:05.420
PARTICIPANT 4 and say, it's not that particular. It's not the same PROJECT as previously, and that's where ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE MAANAGEMENT becomes such a huge piece of the conversation that needs to happen. So starting from the very beginning, right? So sharing, why are we doing it? And why I am doing it? So that PEOPLE can connect to my Vi. And that's very important for a leader to

34
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:15.620
PARTICIPANT 4 to share that vision and that importance of that. Otherwise, you know, folks are not gonna be behind that particular PROJECT. So I

35
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.190
PARTICIPANT 4 that's where we started and and went from there.

36
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:44.270
Unice Harris: That makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing that when you started. How did you communicate that corporate? Why was it EMAIL, or MEETING, or sharepoint or other? What other kind of form of COMMUNICATION. How did you guys communicate the PURPOSE of that PROJECT? Alright? So it was. First of all, it was in the program chart

37
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:57.449
PARTICIPANT 4 very clearly. What is the PURPOSE of the PROJECT? So we redefined our charter and clearly defined that then it was more in terms of one on one

38
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:07.379
PARTICIPANT 4 MEETINGS with the with the TEAM members reiterating that. And then also as part of TEAM MEETINGS. We shared it because it. You know folks

39
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:25.169
Unice Harris: need to listen it multiple times before they get it. Got it? Got it? That's perfect. Can you also share a time when you did not, or when someone on the TEAM starting the PROJECT did not communicate the PURPOSE of the PROJECT or TRANSFORMATION.

40
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.079
Unice Harris: And how? What? That experience was

41
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.739
PARTICIPANT 4 right, you know previously.

42
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:44.469
PARTICIPANT 4 When I was not in the role of a pro program man or PROJECT manager for that. But previously, I think, the the PURPOSE wasn't defined clearly

43
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:56.189
PARTICIPANT 4 and wasn't communicated. You know, it was communicated as, oh, it's a it's a TECHNOLOGY PROJECT, right? We are just upgrading upgrading our permit SYSTEM.

44
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:11.930
PARTICIPANT 4 So that's not the PURPOSE of your PROJECT, right PURPOSEs more, how it's changing lives, how it's impacting our community. Our customers. How you know it. It's it's

45
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:17.270
PARTICIPANT 4 it's it's the way you communicate. I'm gonna give you an example. So

46
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:41.469
PARTICIPANT 4 we went to I went to see the TEAM. I want to see the work which was being done. And this was basically a permit SYSTEM. Additional TRANSFORMATION PROJECT for for putting a permit SYSTEM which has been never upgraded for 20 years. So I went to visit the permit SYSTEM, and all the plans were being submitted through paper.

47
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:55.009
PARTICIPANT 4 and I saw, like, you know, bandages and first aid boxes over there. And I was like, why do we have this like? Why do you have these bandage boxes and apartment SYSTEMS? They were like, you know, Savi, you don't believe.

48
00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:04.399
PARTICIPANT 4 you know that, how many paper cuts we get every single day? Because we have to deal with all these papers

49
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:17.209
PARTICIPANT 4 and those paper cuts are oh, man, I can't! I can't even imagine. So we have bandages. So there was like there was like blood on those on those paper

50
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:36.460
PARTICIPANT 4 on those on those design papers, right on those. She's those like man. We're not. We're not. We're not upgrading apartment SYSTEM. We're changing lives. We're saving PEOPLE's blood right? Taking it in a funny way. That's the kind of real stories where PEOPLE connect with you, so I don't think that was ever

51
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:47.319
PARTICIPANT 4 communicated in that way, saying, You know, why are we doing it? It was just like, you know, it's a PROJECT, and we have to upgrade our SYSTEM. Or we're putting a NEW permit SYSTEM in place.

52
00:14:47.650 --> 00:15:00.779
Unice Harris: Perfect question number 2 during the requirements or other phase of the TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you informed cross-functional TEAMS of the ORGANIZATION within the ORGANIZATION as a whole.

53
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:11.949
Unice Harris: of how the TRANSFORMATION was specifically impact them, and how would affect or impact or enhance how they do their work. So a time where

54
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:26.799
Unice Harris: a lot of times when you implement a TRANSFORMATION, it impacts multiple different DEPARTMENTs. And I'm asking to share how you informed the cross functional TEAMS about how it would specifically impact their work.

55
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.920
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah. So this was more again, one-on-one MEETINGS with those STAKEHOLDERS identifying that.

56
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.269
Unice Harris: And then we also had a customer STAKEHOLDER group.

57
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:44.210
PARTICIPANT 4 which was part of the which was actually the part of the governance TEAM, right? So the the

58
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:58.310
PARTICIPANT 4 it wasn't making the decision on what goes in and what goes out. We were the facilitators of the that discussion. But the Governance Committee was the one which came together and said, Okay, these are the things which

59
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:19.689
PARTICIPANT 4 which we should go in phase, one phase 2, phase 3. And you know they understand the business well, so they kNEW what impact it's gonna have on that. But that was one way of doing that, and also second one was getting their feedback from them. Not only through 101's, but also through SURVEYs

60
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:46.410
PARTICIPANT 4 we had, ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE manager as part of the TEAM. And she had the COMMUNICATIONs TEAM under her and as well as the TRAINING TEAM according to her. And they were MEETING those STAKEHOLDERS and figuring it out, how it's gonna impact them and how we can, how we can minimize the impact as well as how do we train them for the NEW CHANGES which are gonna impact them?

61
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:57.699
Unice Harris: Got it perfect? And then, when you did that, did you feel like it minimized confusion about how the solution will impact each of them.

62
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.480
PARTICIPANT 4 Absolutely.

63
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.710
Unice Harris: Okay.

64
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.349
Unice Harris: Question number 3

65
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:21.009
Unice Harris: in the design phase or any other phase before development of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION life cycle or any other phase. Can you share how you provide a TRAINING relative to the NEW PROCESS TECHNOLOGY or NEW TRANSFORMATION initiative.

66
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:39.240
PARTICIPANT 4 Right? So we used to do open house sessions and then we should do town halls. So open House sessions was we would bring it. We will bring all the STAKEHOLDERS together. We'll give them update. We'll probably

67
00:17:39.580 --> 00:18:02.379
PARTICIPANT 4 give them a demo of one of the functionalities to start communicating about the CHANGE, and then back to them. We also dig Town Hall MEETINGS, where we would bring the whole TEAM together, invite everyone and anyone to come and ask any questions which they have. We also created TRAINING materials different kind of TRAINING materials. We had

68
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:20.220
PARTICIPANT 4 the TRAINING TEAM creating online TRAINING videos the documentation of the NEW PROCESSES. And then also how like classroom type TRAININGs to get the users ready for the NEW the NEW CHANGE.

69
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:28.910
Unice Harris: Got it? Okay? And did you find that that minimize confusion about how the solution would impact them?

70
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:53.010
PARTICIPANT 4 Yes, TRAINING is such a key piece of helping the user to minimize the impact which is which which they're gonna have. And you know, doing that one on one sessions with some of the key STAKEHOLDERS who were the critical folks in there and helping them do that walk through was very helpful, and they were very appreciative of that approach.

71
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.170
Unice Harris: Okay.

72
00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:07.820
Unice Harris: thank you. Can you also share a time where you didn't provide TRAINING or you know th, the or the PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS or PROJECT managers or program managers didn't provide the TRAINING

73
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.270
PARTICIPANT 4 you know.

74
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:18.420
PARTICIPANT 4 for that specific for that specific PROJECT.

75
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:30.320
PARTICIPANT 4 I you know, I don't think that we we left any of the STAKEHOLDERS group out. So we did provide TRAINING. But for any other PROJECT.

76
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:51.500
PARTICIPANT 4 Let me think if you know, especially your, your question is more related to the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROJECT. Not like, yeah, E, and and you could be TRANSFORMing a PROCESS of program and application or anything to a more DIGITAL approach.

77
00:19:51.820 --> 00:20:18.080
Unice Harris: and if there was a time and and some in some cases there just wasn't a time. A lot of times. PEOPLE, you know, can't find a time where they haven't provided the necessary TRAINING. And if you don't have anything in your experience, you know, that's that's okay. But is there a time where you, you know, just didn't see the TRAINING provided? And what was the experience around that?

78
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:39.699
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah. we have, you know, in my experiences, we did have. We have provided TRAINING. But the level of TRAINING could be different where we didn't have the capacity to train everybody so. But we just provided them with the link, saying, Okay, here's the TRAINING. Go and attend it. Right? So that wasn't the

79
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:53.559
PARTICIPANT 4 because we didn't have the capacity to provide that, you know, classroom TRAINING or one on one TRAINING. We just send them a link and said, here you go. That wasn't the best experience for the end users, and that caused a lot of questions. And

80
00:20:53.560 --> 00:21:09.480
PARTICIPANT 4 you know, lot of time from our perspective to to answer those questions at a later time, or to resolve some of the tickets which were related to not able to do a good job with that TRAINING

81
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.300
Unice Harris: perfect makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing

82
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:28.719
Unice Harris: question number 4 in the TESTING phase of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION lifecycle. Can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS, maybe a user acceptance test to confirm that it works the way it should.

83
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:34.879
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah. So we used to do. You know,

84
00:21:35.640 --> 00:22:04.379
PARTICIPANT 4 we had a Qid quality assurance TESTING. And then Ua user acceptance TESTING we automated our test script. So at least from the TECHNOLOGY perspective, we we which actually helped in fast tracking some of the TESTING because some of those TRANSFORMATIONs you need to deliver at a fast pace because of so many dependencies on that. And then the user acceptance TESTING was a mix of

85
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:25.090
PARTICIPANT 4 you know, a business analyst basically working with with end users where they have already identified the used cases test use cases and going through those step by step and making sure those that th the outcome which is identified

86
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:33.180
PARTICIPANT 4 matches with what we actually get. So we did put focus on the Qat and the Uat and that

87
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.260
Unice Harris: perfect

88
00:22:36.790 --> 00:23:02.750
PARTICIPANT 4 do you feel like it helped the implementation? Do you feel like it minimize confusion about how the solution was really, gonna what's supposed to work? Absolutely, you know. It helps to identify the bugs and all the all the the way that the application should behave, or the way a a user is accepting is is

89
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:22.700
PARTICIPANT 4 expecting that application to behave. So it helps to clear out that confusion, and also helps to educate the end user who are TESTING that application. And it's also sometimes a great TRAINING exercise for them how to basically use use the NEW SYSTEM.

90
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.559
Unice Harris: Okay? Can you share a time when you didn't test at all?

91
00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:42.800
Unice Harris: No, no, I've never done. And hopefully, no one should ever be doing or releasing anything without TESTING they, you know. You'd be surprised. I was really surprised, because

92
00:23:43.010 --> 00:24:07.150
Unice Harris: sometimes they do. Sometimes they get caught up in getting to the market first. And so they develop SYSTEMS and solutions. And they just know that it works. And they in their arrogance. They put it out there. Without proper TESTING. And I've seen some really disaster situations.

93
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.929
Unice Harris: resulting from that.

94
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.380
PARTICIPANT 4 I can only imagine. I can only imagine.

95
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.560
Unice Harris: okay, question number 5

96
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:26.489
Unice Harris: after the rollout into production. How were end users, employees, and STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback relative to what worked in production

97
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.080
Unice Harris: and what seemed not to work smoothly.

98
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:39.380
PARTICIPANT 4 Alright. So we had paper copies, feedback forms, basically for the folks who were when we went into the production.

99
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:52.089
PARTICIPANT 4 We also had a online SURVEY. We also provided like a online ticketing SYSTEM, basically to submit any issues which they have.

100
00:24:52.210 --> 00:25:03.730
PARTICIPANT 4 And we we also had identified. I will say the the folks who were present at

101
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:17.189
PARTICIPANT 4 critical locations and to be so that end users can contact them and can provide their feedback to them. So it was a multi layered approach for getting feedback from then users.

102
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:31.720
Unice Harris: and for those PROJECTs that you rolled into production and received that feedback. Those TRANSFORMATIONs? Did they eventually increase revenue?

103
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.920
PARTICIPANT 4 You know, it's a public sector PROJECT. I won't say it increased.

104
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:44.679
PARTICIPANT 4 You know, REVENUEis not the key factor. Focus on that, but

105
00:25:44.820 --> 00:26:07.310
PARTICIPANT 4 But if I look from another way, it did in help and increase, and reducing the pain which, which conversely, help to increase the number of folks who can get through the SYSTEM quickly, absolutely less painful for them. So the barriers were removed.

106
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:17.020
PARTICIPANT 4 or from paper to more online pieces in there that really help them. I think the key piece was the CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

107
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:32.579
Unice Harris:  okay? And so with respect to that CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, you're thinking that because the customer set is satisfied, they're gonna use the SYSTEM more, and that will subsequently increase revenue.

108
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.970
PARTICIPANT 4 Yes.

109
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.250
Unice Harris: okay, gotcha and then

110
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.709
Unice Harris: within the ORGANIZATION, after you rolled it out.

111
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:55.270
Unice Harris: allowed them TRAINING TESTING, and then post production feedback. Do you feel like it? Members of the ORGANIZATION seemed more receptive to CHANGE or more hesitant?

112
00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:23.549
PARTICIPANT 4 I think they were more receptive of the CHANGE. Because then, what we did was we transition it from a PROJECT to a product make based approach. And you know, and part part of that was that we didn't want to be in that same situation. We were earlier. So we put in things in place where we were releasing and updating the SYSTEM

113
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:47.830
PARTICIPANT 4 upgrades every once every 3 months, or 6 months depending upon what was coming out from the vendor side. So we implemented some of the devops principles in getting this getting some of those upgrades out in a in a much quicker way, rather than waiting for years to get some of upgrades done.

114
00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:56.889
Unice Harris: Gotcha? Question number 6. Can you share an example of a TRANSFORMATION that went very well

115
00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:02.430
Unice Harris: also one that didn't go very well. What did you do differently between the 2?

116
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:21.460
PARTICIPANT 4 Yeah. So this is a great example, right implementation of a city of Portland's permit SYSTEM. We call it pops Portland online permitting SYSTEM it. Previously it didn't go. Well, you know, for 10 years had multiple starts and multiple stops. But

117
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:43.149
PARTICIPANT 4 you know, and 2,018 when we came came in and started on this PROJECT again. It went very well. Right? So PEOPLE have this thought that this will never, ever go live. But we were able to go live on February 1020, 20, just before the pandemic happened. So that went that went well.

118
00:28:43.230 --> 00:29:01.469
Unice Harris: wow, wow! That's amazing. So essentially, you were able to take a PROJECT that had been delayed and stopped and behind schedules for more than 10 years or so, and you were able to deliver it within just over 2 years.

119
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.060
Unice Harris: That's amazing. That is amazing.

120
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:17.240
Unice Harris: Question number 7. Can you share any activity taken to create a more DIGITAL innovation mindset within the ORGANIZATION?

121
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:26.730
Unice Harris: And then has it helped or hurt the willingness to CHANGE? And I think that you cover that a little bit. Within your

122
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.860
Unice Harris: honestly just

123
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:58.130
Unice Harris: taking a 10 year PROJECT and delivering it within 2 years. That had to do a whole lot for their DIGITAL innovation mindset. But can you clarify? You know what your perception of of how it helped their mindset and made them more receptive to future PROJECT CHANGES absolutely right? So there were, there were many use cases. So as part of this program, we had 6 different PROJECTs.

124
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:07.890
PARTICIPANT 4 And one of that was ability for inspectors to do their inspection. So what was happening previously was like, if you want to get

125
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:29.029
PARTICIPANT 4 if you're building a house or a commercial building, and you want to get it inspected by a by an inspector. You will call 1 800 number. It will go into a queue then somebody will take all those notes, and we'll put it into the SYSTEM, and in the morning it will print out all the inspections that are supposed to be done

126
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:43.439
PARTICIPANT 4 the Supervisor will look at all those inspections and say, Okay, you know, Inspector A, based on you are here based on your skill set and availability. Here are 3 or 4 inspections you can do through that day.

127
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:53.720
PARTICIPANT 4 Then the inspectors will go back into their seats, start putting the notes in the SYSTEM. Go to Google Maps. Say, Okay, what is the best route I'm gonna take

128
00:30:53.780 --> 00:31:18.059
PARTICIPANT 4 today to do all those 5, 4, or 5 inspections. Then they will go out into the field. They will take all the notes on their on their sheets. Of all the inspections. They did take all the pictures. They will come back into the office, and we'll type those notes back into the SYSTEM and we'll upload all those pictures.

129
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:28.809
PARTICIPANT 4 What we did was we automated that PROCESS inspection PROCESS. So what we did was all the inspections received

130
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:38.389
Unice Harris: an algorithm would run at night, which will look at the availability and the skill set of a particular inspector.

131
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:46.439
PARTICIPANT 4 and depending upon the proximity of you, know where all the inspections need to be done will automize their route.

132
00:31:46.550 --> 00:32:14.280
PARTICIPANT 4 and we'll send that that INFORMATION to the inspector on the inspector app, so they don't even have to come into the office. What they can do is they they will get in the morning saying, Okay, here are the 5 inspections which you need to do right for 6 inspections you need to do. Then they will go on site and they will take the notes right there on the inspector app. They will use that app to take all this, all their pictures.

133
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.540
PARTICIPANT 4 And by the end of the day, you know, they will be

134
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:34.570
PARTICIPANT 4 done, basically with all the inspections without actually coming back into the office and doing that. Do a labor of, you know, taking the notes, writing on a paper, bringing it, you know, break coming back into the office and typing it again. So it it really, you know, helped

135
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:56.439
PARTICIPANT 4 the the folks looking at. Okay, you know, this is not here to make my job up, but it is such a easy PROCESS for me to now to able to do my job effectively, and I'm glad we were able to get that thing done, because that was February 2020. And right after that in March we had

136
00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:08.319
PARTICIPANT 4 Covid, as you know. So folks who are working from home. But at least they were able to get some of these things done because we were able to roll out this functionality? At such a critical time.

137
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:17.460
Unice Harris: Wow! Now, that's innovation. That's innovation. That's that's being able to quickly pivot and innovate where

138
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.219
Unice Harris: others can't. And then

139
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:35.930
Unice Harris: the incorporation into their skill set and to automatically assign them according to their skill. Set. That's amazing. You don't see that often in city government or state government, TECHNOLOGY. So

140
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:44.560
Unice Harris: that's amazing. Question number 9, can you share? Why, you think CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important or not important

141
00:33:47.010 --> 00:34:13.020
PARTICIPANT 4 CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important. You know, the the district TRANSFORMATIONs, as you mentioned, earlier, majority of them fail. And the number one reason that those DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs fail is because of PEOPLE issues. I saw a data somewhere which said, 92% of these failed because of PEOPLE issues. So it's not a TECHNOLOGY CHANGE. It's more PEOPLE CHANGE

142
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:19.960
PARTICIPANT 4 ORGANIZATIONs don't CHANGES to PEOPLE with CHANGE. So that's where the key and the critical

143
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:49.190
PARTICIPANT 4 piece is for making any ORGANIZATION who's looking into additional TRANSFORMATION. That complex TRANSFORMATION need to invest in ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. Make sure the the users are feel comfortable with the CHANGE, and I are able to use the tools and the PROCESSES more effectively, because even if you implement a NEW SYSTEM with and you don't get that, BUYIN

144
00:34:49.190 --> 00:35:00.900
PARTICIPANT 4 and you don't help them to that CHANGE if they don't use it. Basically your that that TRANSFORMATION is a failure. If they keep going back to the old way of doing things

145
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:09.459
PARTICIPANT 4 so ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is, I think, is the number one critical piece for making any TRANSFORMATION SUCCESSFUL.

146
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.680
Unice Harris: Wonderful? Thank you so much. And I tell you what.

147
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:19.830
Unice Harris: it is amazing how the industry is changing, because.

148
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.380
Unice Harris: you know, there are so many failures. I think.

149
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:36.299
Unice Harris: In one study there was approximately 900 billion dollars that you know, was lost. Or miss, yeah, lost as as as a result of

150
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:53.009
Unice Harris: the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONs the PROJECT failures. And that's a lot of money, you know. When you can build simple solutions into those PROJECTs. And I can't tell you how many times.

151
00:35:53.070 --> 00:36:04.879
Unice Harris: It's been beneficial for me to be a consultant because I've been able to go to multiple different fortune. 500 fortune, 100 companies, and I've been able to see

152
00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.920
Unice Harris: first hand

153
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:13.319
Unice Harris: how those PROJECTs fail like you. And the city PROJECT.

154
00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:25.599
Unice Harris: I've gone into situations where PEOPLE were just livid, and I've been told, oh, my gosh! We're expected to go live in a week.

155
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:36.540
Unice Harris: and we've not even been told what the PROJECT is not been trained on it, and we've not tested it, you know. So I've seen situations

156
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.570
Unice Harris: like that. And I've unfortunately

157
00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:51.020
Unice Harris: seen those PROJECTs fail and have had to revise and do them all over again, or rework them into SUCCESSFUL PROJECTs. So.

158
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.389
PARTICIPANT 4 wow, yeah, no, II can totally agree with that, you know. But

159
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:23.129
PARTICIPANT 4 PEOPLE, you know, if if and that was one of the reason, right? PEOPLE think a, it's a TECHNOLOGY PROJECT, or you know, or you know. Sometimes they think it's a business PROJECT, and they don't put effort in educating and not sharing the why and understanding how you know ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE MAANAGEMENT plays such a huge role in making these PROJECTs SUCCESSFUL?

160
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.600
Unice Harris: Absolutely

161
00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:31.350
well, any questions you have for me. Thank you so much. And just like I expected, your input

162
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:42.470
Unice Harris: has been invaluable to the study. I appreciate your feedback. I mean, it's just your experiences are just amazing.

163
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:58.910
Unice Harris: and you really understand the impacts of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT and the shortcomings of not utilizing it to the fullest. So again, I will send you a copy of this conversation. If you want to CHANGE anything, please.

164
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:08.219
Unice Harris: you know. Send it back to me with any CHANGES. Within 3 days, and then again. I'll send you a copy of the final report as well.

165
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:18.640
PARTICIPANT 4 Awesome, awesome good luck! Good luck with your doctorate. Thank you so much. I am almost done. I have one class after this and

166
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:33.559
Unice Harris: I'll be wrapping things up, and I'm hoping that we can work together again sometime in the future. It was again a privilege to have you speak at some of the events. You know the last.

167
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.279
Unice Harris: was it 2, 3 years ago.

168
00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:48.509
Unice Harris: at the local chapter? So, looking forward to the potential of working with you again. Someday. Thank you so much.

Unice Harris: Yes, I am. Can you hear me at all?

12
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.500

15
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:09.029
Unice Harris: So thank you so much for participating. I I just I had to have you come and give your perspective on things. I.

16
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:15.499
Unice Harris: What's that? We we last work together? Dst, and what? 2015? Something like that.

17
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.860
PARTICIPANT 5 And it's good.

18
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:42.429
Unice Harris: One of the things that I was most impressed about you, and I rarely ever see was your ability to connect to PEOPLE that you worked with, and I just don't see that. You know you asked about their children. You asked about their anniversaries, their birthdays, the whole 9, and it was just so impressive to me, you know.

19
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.758
Unice Harris: so thank you again for just joining. And you know, offering your input and

20
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:58.680
Unice Harris: I'll ask you 9 questions about the BENEFITS of incorporating CHANGE MAANAGEMENT into

21
00:14:59.243 --> 00:15:12.236
Unice Harris: TRANSFORMATION. And that TRANSFORMATION could be a PROCESS CHANGE a procedure CHANGE. I know you've done a lot with PROCESS updates and things, or software updates. It could be

22
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:25.699
Unice Harris: any of those things. And just walk through the 9 questions. And you just give me your honest and upfront opinion about it and

23
00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:30.940
Unice Harris: and I know you're gonna do that, anyway. So any questions you have for me.

24
00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:34.149
PARTICIPANT 5 No had to.

25
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.050
Unice Harris: Okay, okay, perfect.

26
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.459
PARTICIPANT 5 Clarify the DIGITAL market because a lot of

27
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.169
PARTICIPANT 5 PROCESS improvement endeavors that we went through

28
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.159
PARTICIPANT 5 at at Dsp, when I work there.

29
00:15:49.096 --> 00:15:51.719
PARTICIPANT 5 We're not necessarily DIGITAL.

30
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.509
PARTICIPANT 5 Were, you know, implementing NEW PROCESSES and things like that. But.

31
00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.629
PARTICIPANT 5 I should be able to answer your question.

32
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.960
Unice Harris: Okay? Sounds good.

33
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.810
Unice Harris: Let's see. Question number one

34
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:14.030
Unice Harris: during the initiation or other phase or start of the PROJECT.

35
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.160
Unice Harris: Can you share a time when you communicated the PURPOSE

36
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.280
Unice Harris: of the TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION.

37
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:33.209
Unice Harris: and how it would enhance or help the ORGANIZATION. So in a nutshell, if you're changing or updating a PROCESS. Was there a time

38
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.080
Unice Harris: when at the start of that you

39
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.209
Unice Harris: communicated the PURPOSE of that PROJECT?

40
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.349
PARTICIPANT 5 Okay, yeah. And

41
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.459
PARTICIPANT 5 I can go back to when I originally

42
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.860
PARTICIPANT 5 starting.

43
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.950
PARTICIPANT 5 Hi, Jacob.

44
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.410
PARTICIPANT 5 and.

45
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.780
Unice Harris: Okay. Awesome.

46
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.200
PARTICIPANT 5 There was a lot of

47
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.790
PARTICIPANT 5 CHANGES that needed to be implemented because it was not a

48
00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.119
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT oriented environment, but

49
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.810
PARTICIPANT 5 because of some

50
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.089
PARTICIPANT 5 failures. The data center has experienced.

51
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.645
PARTICIPANT 5 We

52
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.049
PARTICIPANT 5 had to do something and PROJECT MAANAGEMENT was what

53
00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.840
PARTICIPANT 5 the executives

54
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.249
PARTICIPANT 5 chose to do, and

55
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.600
PARTICIPANT 5 because of my education and background.

56
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.260
PARTICIPANT 5 I was selected to open

57
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.899
PARTICIPANT 5 the PROJECT office environment. And so

58
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.729
PARTICIPANT 5 in that PROCESS.

59
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.700
PARTICIPANT 5 what we ended up doing

60
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.880
PARTICIPANT 5 to market.

61
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.320
PARTICIPANT 5 so to speak.

62
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.270
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT MAANAGEMENT.

63
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.630
PARTICIPANT 5 we ended up

64
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.780
PARTICIPANT 5 a

65
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.410
PARTICIPANT 5 creating

66
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.330
PARTICIPANT 5 a brochure.

67
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.320
Unice Harris: Okay.

68
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.219
PARTICIPANT 5 For the PROJECT office environment.

69
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.799
PARTICIPANT 5 And in that, too, it talked about

70
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.690
PARTICIPANT 5 our primary objectives, our PURPOSEs.

71
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.690
PARTICIPANT 5 our services that we offer.

72
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.640
PARTICIPANT 5 and things that we could do to help

73
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.089
PARTICIPANT 5 the company overall, not just

74
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.140
PARTICIPANT 5 the data center. And so

75
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.619
PARTICIPANT 5 that implementation of COMMUNICATIONs

76
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.969
PARTICIPANT 5 was real, effective in getting other

77
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.010
PARTICIPANT 5 areas and DEPARTMENTs to know

78
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.919
PARTICIPANT 5 about what we

79
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.849
PARTICIPANT 5 we're doing, and.

80
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.440
Unice Harris: Isn't it.

81
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.860
PARTICIPANT 5 It kind of grew from there.

82
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.109
Unice Harris: Okay. Awesome. How did you distribute that brochure?

83
00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:54.869
PARTICIPANT 5 We distributed it via EMAIL. And also we hand it

84
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.550
PARTICIPANT 5 them out. We mailed them in our office to

85
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.749
PARTICIPANT 5 other executive managers and DEPARTMENTs.

86
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.230
PARTICIPANT 5 Every opportunity.

87
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.959
PARTICIPANT 5 every opportunity. I've got

88
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.169
PARTICIPANT 5 to give somebody one out

89
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.080
PARTICIPANT 5 always kept it.

90
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.829
PARTICIPANT 5 a few of them with me. I would pass them out.

91
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.560
PARTICIPANT 5 pass them out to TEAM members and

92
00:19:20.177 --> 00:19:24.000
PARTICIPANT 5 PEOPLE that we were working with on PROJECTs.

93
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.030
PARTICIPANT 5 Boot

94
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.340
PARTICIPANT 5 help them get a better understanding of what

95
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.519
PARTICIPANT 5 the PROJECT office, because it was NEW.

96
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.750
PARTICIPANT 5 and they didn't much about PROJECT MAANAGEMENT. And

97
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.630
PARTICIPANT 5 so we F,

98
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.650
PARTICIPANT 5 that's the word out is

99
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.410
PARTICIPANT 5 as much as we could.

100
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.225
PARTICIPANT 5 and the results came in pretty good, because

101
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.330
PARTICIPANT 5 PEOPLE started asking us to run PROJECTs

102
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.929
PARTICIPANT 5 for them and and other DEPARTMENTs.

103
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.750
Unice Harris: No doubt.

104
00:19:54.569 --> 00:20:02.470
Unice Harris: That's really good. Can you do you? And and you may not have a time when you had did this. But

105
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:10.089
Unice Harris: can you share a time when you did not communicate the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION or the PROJECT.

106
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.489
PARTICIPANT 5 Unice COMMUNICATION was always key.

107
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.659
PARTICIPANT 5 It is ice cream.

108
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.430
PARTICIPANT 5 can't?

109
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.649
PARTICIPANT 5 Well, that effect of COMMUNICATION.

110
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.209
PARTICIPANT 5 You you're not gonna get very, very far.

111
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.670
PARTICIPANT 5 So

112
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.620
PARTICIPANT 5 I spent a majority of my time

113
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.220
PARTICIPANT 5 communicating

114
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.549
PARTICIPANT 5 to PEOPLE trying to get them

115
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:54.850
PARTICIPANT 5 to see the big picture in the environment that I was in. They didn't have a good understanding of PROJECT MAANAGEMENT and what was supposed to happen.

116
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.739
PARTICIPANT 5 So I was always kind of teaching.

117
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.070
PARTICIPANT 5 as I went

118
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.419
PARTICIPANT 5 to, you know. Bring them

119
00:21:03.407 --> 00:21:08.829
PARTICIPANT 5 communicate to them. You know what we were doing in the PROJECT office?

120
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.009
PARTICIPANT 5 What PROJECT MAANAGEMENT was all about, how those

121
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.640
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECTs could, how how the PROJECT MAANAGEMENT concept

122
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.990
PARTICIPANT 5 could

123
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.120
PARTICIPANT 5 help

124
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.099
PARTICIPANT 5 the environment and.

125
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.020
Unice Harris: Some words.

126
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.960
Unice Harris: That's really good. Okay.

127
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.380
PARTICIPANT 5 Really.

128
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:41.139
Unice Harris: Thank you, ma'am. Question number 2 during the requirements or any other phase of DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONal. Your PROCESS updates, as you mentioned.

129
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:47.769
Unice Harris: can you share how you inform cross functional TEAMS or the ORGANIZATION as a whole.

130
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:55.650
Unice Harris: of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically, and how it would affect or impact or enhance

131
00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.709
Unice Harris: how they do their work. And I think you talked a little bit about the brochure

132
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:18.070
Unice Harris: that you distributed throughout the ORGANIZATION. Can you further expand on that. Did that include the cross functional TEAMS that it would impact and did? Was there a way that you clarified? How it would impact them and CHANGE their work.

133
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.570
PARTICIPANT 5 The

134
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.219
PARTICIPANT 5 the brochure primarily talked about architecture.

135
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.679
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT, office, and services that we

136
00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.600
PARTICIPANT 5 provided to get PEOPLE acclimated

137
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.990
PARTICIPANT 5 within my TEAM.

138
00:22:39.068 --> 00:22:44.990
PARTICIPANT 5 We did a lot of it was a matrix environment. So we did a lot of possible

139
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.270
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT. Then

140
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.810
PARTICIPANT 5 because we

141
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.589
PARTICIPANT 5 of these.

142
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.749
PARTICIPANT 5 we were able to communicate

143
00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:58.210
PARTICIPANT 5 to

144
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.230
PARTICIPANT 5 PEOPLE about the different

145
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.290
PARTICIPANT 5 specific PROJECT.

146
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.670
PARTICIPANT 5 They had a good understanding of what we were doing.

147
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.280
PARTICIPANT 5 I would say

148
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.060
PARTICIPANT 5 within each PROJECT.

149
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.850
PARTICIPANT 5 And so.

150
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:23.349
PARTICIPANT 5 Though the overall CHANGE of TRANSFORMATION into

151
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.519
PARTICIPANT 5 a PROJECT MAANAGEMENT environment.

152
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.130
PARTICIPANT 5 that kind of caught on

153
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.500
PARTICIPANT 5 as time went up

154
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.339
PARTICIPANT 5 and I kNEW that it caught on.

155
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.200
PARTICIPANT 5 Has

156
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.620
PARTICIPANT 5 PEOPLE

157
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.060
PARTICIPANT 5 began. Other managers and executives

158
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.440
PARTICIPANT 5 begin asking us to do their PROJECTs instead of just

159
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.650
PARTICIPANT 5 giving them giving them to. You know

160
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.989
PARTICIPANT 5 the IT. Text.

161
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.259
Unice Harris: good answer. Okay. Question number 3

162
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:07.969
Unice Harris: in the design phase, or any other phase before development of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, lifecycle.

163
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.749
Unice Harris: can you share how you provided TRAINING

164
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:17.229
Unice Harris: relative to the NEW PROCESS or NEW TECHNOLOGY or NEW TRANSFORMATION initiative.

165
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.160
PARTICIPANT 5 Absolutely a part of our both share was TRAINING.

166
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.070
PARTICIPANT 5 And so we have PROJECT MAANAGEMENT TRAINING classes

167
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:37.429
PARTICIPANT 5 where we, you know, PEOPLE get the phone up for the classes. And then when we first started out, though, I missed the plane

168
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.500
PARTICIPANT 5 bout

169
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.040
PARTICIPANT 5 8 and 800 to a thousand PEOPLE.

170
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.610
PARTICIPANT 5 just

171
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.180
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT MAANAGEMENT

172
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.010
PARTICIPANT 5 software SYSTEM

173
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.249
PARTICIPANT 5 and we use their tr time tracking

174
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.670
PARTICIPANT 5 device. And so I train PEOPLE on how to do that. And so in that.

175
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.539
PARTICIPANT 5 we talked about the reasons

176
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.980
PARTICIPANT 5 for the CHANGES

177
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:13.150
PARTICIPANT 5 of implementing time entry, of implementing PROJECT MAANAGEMENT software, how we were going to be using it throughout the ORGANIZATION.

178
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:17.750
PARTICIPANT 5 the BENEFITS of it, because a lot of PEOPLE, of course, you know they

179
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.179
PARTICIPANT 5 they think, well, you know, how is this gonna help me?

180
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.700
PARTICIPANT 5 So we need to make sure we address

181
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.659
PARTICIPANT 5 the what's in it for me.

182
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:32.419
PARTICIPANT 5 part of the of the TRAINING. So yeah, we had. I had

183
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.649
PARTICIPANT 5 yeah, lots of TRAINING classes.

184
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.568
Unice Harris: Awesome that that is so good because

185
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.725
Unice Harris: a lot of times

186
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:55.249
Unice Harris: you know that that's not included. And PEOPLE are left to, you know, kind of figure it out on their own. So you know, thank you for sharing that, because, you know, we

187
00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:01.821
Unice Harris: we do see a lot of situations where there just is no TRAINING.

188
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:14.479
Unice Harris: question 4. In the TESTING phase of the TRANSFORMATION lifecycle. Can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS.

189
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:22.469
Unice Harris: like maybe user acceptance, TESTING any other kind of TESTING to confirm that it works the way it should.

190
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.190
PARTICIPANT 5 All.

191
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.350
PARTICIPANT 5 it wasn't like we were designed

192
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.620
PARTICIPANT 5 what it was

193
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.110
PARTICIPANT 5 introducing

194
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.190
PARTICIPANT 5 classes.

195
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.630
PARTICIPANT 5 and sometimes it

196
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:42.280
PARTICIPANT 5 implementing NEW templates for them that you use for PROJECT MAANAGEMENT.

197
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.549
PARTICIPANT 5 or, you know, allowing providing them with

198
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.589
PARTICIPANT 5 templates to

199
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:56.639
PARTICIPANT 5 do risk MAANAGEMENT, to define scope of a PROJECT and things like that, a PROJECT charter

200
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.620
PARTICIPANT 5 implementing those things. And so

201
00:27:00.681 --> 00:27:04.139
PARTICIPANT 5 we just gradually added to

202
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.399
PARTICIPANT 5 the PROCESSES over time.

203
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.460
PARTICIPANT 5 Now, as far as TESTING.

204
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.939
PARTICIPANT 5 we didn't like have an actual user test. But

205
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.200
PARTICIPANT 5 I know that it worked because I started.

206
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.919
PARTICIPANT 5 I started seeing the documentation throughout the ORGANIZATION

207
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:33.210
PARTICIPANT 5 like other PEOPLE outside of PROJECT Office. When they started a PROJECT, they would use the documentation that are the templates that we provided.

208
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.580
Unice Harris: Hope.

209
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.269
PARTICIPANT 5 Part of our service.

210
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.230
Unice Harris: Good. Okay.

211
00:27:40.816 --> 00:27:45.109
Unice Harris: Question number 5 after the rollout into production.

212
00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.970
Unice Harris: How are end users, employees and STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback

213
00:27:51.020 --> 00:28:00.389
Unice Harris: relative to what worked in production and what seemed not to work so smoothly. How did they offer you that feedback, or did they have an opportunity to.

214
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.470
PARTICIPANT 5 Because, you know, when I was

215
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.304
PARTICIPANT 5 would help them by, you know, sending them INFORMATION.

216
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:18.120
PARTICIPANT 5 Follow up and ask them how how it worked for them. Is there anything that we can CHANGE, or anything that we can

217
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.609
PARTICIPANT 5 do to make it work better for them and things like that?

218
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.310
PARTICIPANT 5 Most of the time, they pretty much accept it.

219
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.579
PARTICIPANT 5 What it. That

220
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.510
PARTICIPANT 5 thing that actually happened was

221
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.390
PARTICIPANT 5 the executive

222
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.749
PARTICIPANT 5 at DST.

223
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.770
PARTICIPANT 5 Started being

224
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.080
PARTICIPANT 5 this documentation.

225
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.830
PARTICIPANT 5 And you know it was really professional. And

226
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.470
PARTICIPANT 5 so they would

227
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.870
PARTICIPANT 5 that you know they're they're staff.

228
00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.730
PARTICIPANT 5 Where's the

229
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.010
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT planned, I think. Where's the

230
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.310
PARTICIPANT 5 Microsoft PROJECT in?

231
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.189
PARTICIPANT 5 And things like that, you know. Where's this template? Are? You know what's

232
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:03.730
PARTICIPANT 5 play it?

233
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.360
PARTICIPANT 5 And so they would start asking for it. But in

234
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:12.519
PARTICIPANT 5 in the TRAINING that I didn't mention was that

235
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:17.999
PARTICIPANT 5 I had many one on ones with executives down there.

236
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.040
PARTICIPANT 5 They weren't gonna all come to a TRAINING session.

237
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.639
PARTICIPANT 5 I did one on one session and began teaching

238
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.270
PARTICIPANT 5 about PROJECT MAANAGEMENT.

239
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.519
PARTICIPANT 5 So you know what a sponsor's role is, what

240
00:29:34.416 --> 00:29:38.629
PARTICIPANT 5 what role they play in PROJECT MAANAGEMENT, and

241
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:46.353
PARTICIPANT 5 you know, showing them the importance of the documents that we were using. And so that's going on

242
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.350
PARTICIPANT 5 while

243
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.930
PARTICIPANT 5 for TRAINING for them, and making sure they understood.

244
00:29:55.629 --> 00:29:56.439
PARTICIPANT 5 Work that we.

245
00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.690
Unice Harris: That is amazing. Huh?

246
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.539
PARTICIPANT 5 Yeah, I would.

247
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.280
PARTICIPANT 5 It was a battle. I

248
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.140
PARTICIPANT 5 I work probably 80.

249
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.839
PARTICIPANT 5 A lot of those conversations were like after work.

250
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.199
PARTICIPANT 5 after hours.

251
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.330
PARTICIPANT 5 Over dinner, or something like that.

252
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.625
Unice Harris: Wow.

253
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.500
Unice Harris: okay.

254
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:28.280
Unice Harris: Question number 6, can you share an example of a TRANSFORMATION that went very well?

255
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:34.639
Unice Harris: Also one that didn't go so very well. And what did you do differently between the 2.

256
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.690
PARTICIPANT 5 Hey? One that went.

257
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.869
PARTICIPANT 5 I would say, was the the setup

258
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.479
PARTICIPANT 5 and the implementation

259
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.210
PARTICIPANT 5 of the PROJECT office environment.

260
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.779
PARTICIPANT 5 which came with the setup of NEW PROCESSES.

261
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.797
PARTICIPANT 5 NEW development of

262
00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.590
PARTICIPANT 5 of software implementations. NEW.

263
00:31:04.322 --> 00:31:07.220
PARTICIPANT 5 A NEW way of doing work.

264
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:13.100
PARTICIPANT 5 I think the PROJECT office environment that we did set up was very effective.

265
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.210
PARTICIPANT 5 and I feel like it was a true SUCCESS.

266
00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.380
PARTICIPANT 5 for the ORGANIZATION overall.

267
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.190
Unice Harris: Susan.

268
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.710
PARTICIPANT 5 Add the opportunity to run most of the

269
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.680
PARTICIPANT 5 biggest PROJECTs in the corporation

270
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.815
PARTICIPANT 5 and

271
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.729
PARTICIPANT 5 or well recognized

272
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.130
PARTICIPANT 5 for our work.

273
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:40.079
PARTICIPANT 5 One thing that didn't go so well early on before.

274
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.400
PARTICIPANT 5 I was educated enough to be

275
00:31:44.515 --> 00:31:49.910
PARTICIPANT 5 a PROJECT manager, I mean a PROJECT a manager in the PROJECT office.

276
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.270
PARTICIPANT 5 early on they brought consultants in.

277
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.230
PARTICIPANT 5 They're

278
00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.850
PARTICIPANT 5 help us to develop

279
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.440
PARTICIPANT 5 a PROJECT MAANAGEMENT PROCESS.

280
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.639
PARTICIPANT 5 And we were to come up with a PROCESS for PROJECT MAANAGEMENT.

281
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.069
PARTICIPANT 5 and they came up with this really super long

282
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.240
PARTICIPANT 5 last week came up with this super

283
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.120
PARTICIPANT 5 long PROCESS

284
00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.560
PARTICIPANT 5 to implement PROJECT MAANAGEMENT at the data center.

285
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.950
PARTICIPANT 5 And it was so complex

286
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.330
PARTICIPANT 5 that.

287
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.480
PARTICIPANT 5 you know, when we showed it, after 3 months of

288
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.280
PARTICIPANT 5 5 days a week in a room with 12 PEOPLE.

289
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.770
PARTICIPANT 5 yeah. But afterwards

290
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.350
PARTICIPANT 5 nobody used it just

291
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.559
PARTICIPANT 5 and so that was a complete failure.

292
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:53.879
PARTICIPANT 5 And it was a lessons learned for me. I learned a lot of SYSTEMS out of that

293
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.608
PARTICIPANT 5 12. We are 3 months

294
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.700
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT to TRANSFORM PROJECT MAANAGEMENT.

295
00:33:04.564 --> 00:33:08.455
PARTICIPANT 5 And one of the things that I learned was simplify things

296
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:13.610
PARTICIPANT 5 not to make the PROCESSES overwhelming.

297
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.110
PARTICIPANT 5 so that PEOPLE would look, would look at. It wouldn't look at

298
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.490
PARTICIPANT 5 movement.

299
00:33:21.578 --> 00:33:24.860
PARTICIPANT 5 And that's, you know, kind of what happened. And the difference

300
00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:30.879
PARTICIPANT 5 between the 2, the way that I implemented the PROJECT office environment.

301
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.320
PARTICIPANT 5 Was to simplify things.

302
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.270
Unice Harris: Okay.

303
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.850
Unice Harris: and the path of least resistance. And SIM, the SIM, the simplicity of it.

304
00:33:43.574 --> 00:33:51.650
Unice Harris: Made that PROJECT more SUCCESSFUL is what I think I'm hearing you to say. And then, when you created that Pmo

305
00:33:51.850 --> 00:34:00.500
Unice Harris: and simplified that PROCESS increased throughput, made things easier. Did it subsequently help to increase revenue.

306
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:07.830
PARTICIPANT 5 Yes, it do, because of some of the PROJECTs that we executed for revenue

307
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:09.100
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT.

308
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.529
PARTICIPANT 5 and we did acquisitions. And you know about that.

309
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:20.670
PARTICIPANT 5 Yes, he did a lot of acquisitions, and you know that was, you know, how much can we save

310
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.809
PARTICIPANT 5 from this PROJECT? I did a lot of that type of analysis

311
00:34:25.514 --> 00:34:27.509
PARTICIPANT 5 by, when we

312
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.899
PARTICIPANT 5 made it released and

313
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.240
PARTICIPANT 5 providing INFORMATION that

314
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.899
PARTICIPANT 5 we could use to cut

315
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:41.459
PARTICIPANT 5 the amount of spending we were doing

316
00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:48.350
PARTICIPANT 5 on these accusations, and you know, how can we save money and generate more revenue

317
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.320
PARTICIPANT 5 by acquiring these NEW companies?

318
00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.379
PARTICIPANT 5 I did a lot of analysis for that

319
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.700
PARTICIPANT 5 and and we also generated PROCESSES

320
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.639
PARTICIPANT 5 for those NEW client acquisitions.

321
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.189
PARTICIPANT 5 You know. Here's what we'll do

322
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.959
PARTICIPANT 5 when a NEW company comes on. Here's a list of things that

323
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.860
PARTICIPANT 5 are the PROCESSES that we'll do

324
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.170
PARTICIPANT 5 when acquiring.

325
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:27.410
PARTICIPANT 5 I think by the time that you got there after I left the Sp. And by the time you got there, and I came in as a consultant.

326
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:32.469
PARTICIPANT 5 That all that INFORMATION was was gone, and none of that.

327
00:35:33.145 --> 00:35:35.770
PARTICIPANT 5 None of those tools were being used.

328
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.080
Unice Harris: Wow?

329
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:43.898
Unice Harris: Well, and that that makes sense. Because there were there was a lot of

330
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.049
Unice Harris: disorder around that that PROCESS. So

331
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.314
Unice Harris: that makes perfect sense. Let's see.

332
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.510
Unice Harris: question number 7,

333
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:07.840
Unice Harris: when you created that PROCESS the m and a merges and acquisition that's one of the bigger

334
00:36:08.481 --> 00:36:19.790
Unice Harris: types of TRANSFORMATIONs and innovations that you'll see. Can you share any activity that you took to create a DIGITAL innovation mindset

335
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:25.870
Unice Harris: within the ORGANIZATION? And did it help or hurt their willingness to CHANGE?

336
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:32.129
Unice Harris: Or you know how, I guess, how did you create

337
00:36:33.352 --> 00:36:42.739
Unice Harris: an innovation, mindset their willingness to participate in the merger, acquisition, or any other kind of CHANGE.

338
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.430
PARTICIPANT 5 hmm

339
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.820
PARTICIPANT 5 hateful.

340
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.389
Unice Harris: I can just barely hear you.

341
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.560
PARTICIPANT 5 I said, are you talking about

342
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.250
PARTICIPANT 5 company we hired.

343
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.199
PARTICIPANT 5 or you talking about? Dsp.

344
00:37:14.168 --> 00:37:17.210
Unice Harris: Dsc, the in in internal

345
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:22.919
Unice Harris: employees. Is there some special PROCESS that you use to

346
00:37:24.118 --> 00:37:31.420
Unice Harris: get them more readily? Able to receive the TRANSFORMATION, the CHANGE.

347
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.539
PARTICIPANT 5 from a PROJECT MAANAGEMENT perspective, you know, this week

348
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.210
PARTICIPANT 5 had to.

349
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.629
PARTICIPANT 5 When those PROJECTs came alone they came to our DEPARTMENT.

350
00:37:47.279 --> 00:37:47.620
Unice Harris: And.

351
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.230
PARTICIPANT 5 So when they came along, I was

352
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.139
PARTICIPANT 5 in there at the very, very beginning.

353
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.679
PARTICIPANT 5 And so when

354
00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.860
PARTICIPANT 5 we had created those PROCESSES

355
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.650
PARTICIPANT 5 that we would use, you know.

356
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.180
PARTICIPANT 5 in order, you know, from PROJECT Kickoff all the way

357
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.639
PARTICIPANT 5 through, you know, having

358
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.110
PARTICIPANT 5 Microsoft PROJECT, plan, template.

359
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.899
PARTICIPANT 5 and everything that we could not

360
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.720
PARTICIPANT 5 for each client.

361
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.970
PARTICIPANT 5 so that we kNEW exactly

362
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:26.100
PARTICIPANT 5 how long it would take. Now it was a PROJECT MAANAGEMENT thing

363
00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.590
PARTICIPANT 5 that would execute those PROCESS.

364
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.439
PARTICIPANT 5 so there was no need for

365
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:38.229
PARTICIPANT 5 other like TEAM members or anything to be acclimated

366
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.510
PARTICIPANT 5 to those PROCESSES.

367
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.220
PARTICIPANT 5 because primarily they counted on us as PROJECT managers

368
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.530
PARTICIPANT 5 to make it happen.

369
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.160
Unice Harris: Got it? Okay?

370
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:54.889
Unice Harris: Question number 8 after the rollout into production?

371
00:38:55.584 --> 00:39:09.060
Unice Harris: How did the TRANSFORMATION give you or the employees and STAKEHOLDERS the results that were expected. So when you rolled out your Pmo. Or your merger and acquisition.

372
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:14.479
Unice Harris: did the STAKEHOLDERS did the employees get what they expected?

373
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.770
Unice Harris: Or was it something totally different.

374
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.610
PARTICIPANT 5 I think they all got what they.

375
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.450
PARTICIPANT 5 I think I didn't let me be like

376
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.929
PARTICIPANT 5 I think they really didn't know what.

377
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.539
PARTICIPANT 5 The SUCCESSes of PROJECT

378
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:36.399
PARTICIPANT 5 was a clear indicator that our PROCESSES were work.

379
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.560
PARTICIPANT 5 Because our PROJECT?

380
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.920
PARTICIPANT 5 we

381
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.270
PARTICIPANT 5 the PROJECT office we're in anywhere

382
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.659
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECTs a year.

383
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.709
PARTICIPANT 5 And during that timeframe

384
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.169
PARTICIPANT 5 our SUCCESS rate was somewhere around 85 to 90%.

385
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.660
Unice Harris: No. BENEFITS.

386
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:10.589
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECTs that PROJECTs were executed. There may have been some issues with some PROJECTs.

387
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.030
PARTICIPANT 5 but our PROJECTs

388
00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:16.230
PARTICIPANT 5 generally completed on, on.

389
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.769
PARTICIPANT 5 within budget.

390
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.120
PARTICIPANT 5 and

391
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.049
PARTICIPANT 5 achieve the objectives that we were going.

392
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.630
Unice Harris: You know. And and that's amazing. Dr. Gloria.

393
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:52.950
Unice Harris: because you don't see that anymore. You don't. You don't see those SUCCESS rates like that anymore. When you say 80%, 90% SUCCESS rate, you know, that's part of the reason why I'm doing my study is because 75% of PROJECTs fail.

394
00:40:53.370 --> 00:41:00.850
Unice Harris: And they continue. And that number keeps going up and up and up and higher. And that's one of the reasons why

395
00:41:01.354 --> 00:41:16.859
Unice Harris: I brought you into the study, because when you created your Pmo you built in certain controls certain measure, certain CHANGE MAANAGEMENT practices that have kind of fallen by the wayside.

396
00:41:17.361 --> 00:41:28.890
Unice Harris: As we progress through the years, and I think that falling by the waste side is contributing immensely to the increase in PROJECT failures.

397
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.030
Unice Harris: So

398
00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:32.159
Unice Harris: it

399
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.640
Unice Harris: go ahead. I'm sorry.

400
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.300
PARTICIPANT 5 Be

401
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.830
PARTICIPANT 5 Tammy

402
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.130
PARTICIPANT 5 planning

403
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.080
PARTICIPANT 5 Dawson.

404
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.300
PARTICIPANT 5 we had

405
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.010
PARTICIPANT 5 planning class

406
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.439
PARTICIPANT 5 and it was 4 weeks long.

407
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.919
PARTICIPANT 5 now, we could start the PROJECT

408
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.920
PARTICIPANT 5 for 4, weeks, we're concentrating

409
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.790
PARTICIPANT 5 on the plane itself

410
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.269
PARTICIPANT 5 a SUCCESSFUL plan

411
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.970
PARTICIPANT 5 campaign for PROJECT usage.

412
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.979
PARTICIPANT 5 Our TEAMS was one of those areas that you

413
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.379
PARTICIPANT 5 didn't hear a lot about

414
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.569
PARTICIPANT 5 PROJECT issues and problems.

415
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.630
PARTICIPANT 5 those PROJECTs that were blowing up.

416
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.270
PARTICIPANT 5 I'll

417
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.980
PARTICIPANT 5 did not come.

418
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.230
PARTICIPANT 5 Did

419
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.470
PARTICIPANT 5 you found it very

420
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:37.860
PARTICIPANT 5 mad

421
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.420
PARTICIPANT 5 up to speed with the knowledge.

422
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.990
PARTICIPANT 5 manage positive.

423
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:45.200
PARTICIPANT 5 And we're even gonna

424
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.590
PARTICIPANT 5 PEOPLE by default.

425
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.010
PARTICIPANT 5 But overall.

426
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.800
PARTICIPANT 5 our PROJECTs were SUCCESSFUL because we put in the work

427
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.850
PARTICIPANT 5 wrong.

428
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.419
Unice Harris: well, that makes a huge difference.

429
00:43:01.105 --> 00:43:04.509
Unice Harris: Thank you for sharing that question number 9,

430
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.029
Unice Harris: can you share why you think, CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important.

431
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.319
Unice Harris: or why you think that it's not important.

432
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.800
PARTICIPANT 5 It is important, because, in order for

433
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.039
PARTICIPANT 5 phase, one of the things that we did was

434
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.019
PARTICIPANT 5 at the end of every PROJECT. We did

435
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:24.420
PARTICIPANT 5 a

436
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.670
PARTICIPANT 5 lessons learned and be pulled out.

437
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.810
PARTICIPANT 5 things that we could improve upon and documented those things and work on

438
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.330
PARTICIPANT 5 because

439
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.840
PARTICIPANT 5 pages.

440
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.270
PARTICIPANT 5 once they're implemented.

441
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.720
PARTICIPANT 5 things CHANGE over time. And so

442
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:48.540
PARTICIPANT 5 you think it's important because you want to consistently improve

443
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.149
PARTICIPANT 5 the PROCESSing

444
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.140
PARTICIPANT 5 have in place

445
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.620
PARTICIPANT 5 so they can.

446
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.810
PARTICIPANT 5 you know.

447
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.939
PARTICIPANT 5 are missed, and things like that so

448
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.590
PARTICIPANT 5 have to thank you.

449
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.850
PARTICIPANT 5 Work line

450
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.859
PARTICIPANT 5 those issues that

451
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:08.019
PARTICIPANT 5 maybe didn't work so well within a PROJECT. What could we

452
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.539
PARTICIPANT 5 to improve upon

453
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:14.769
PARTICIPANT 5 those PROCESSES? And what things do we need to CHANGE

454
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.970
PARTICIPANT 5 about our PROCESS in order to be better.

455
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.082
Unice Harris: Absolutely, absolutely

456
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:28.880
Unice Harris: well, that was the last question. And I want to thank you again for

457
00:44:29.582 --> 00:44:34.880
Unice Harris: providing your input and feedback into those questions.

458
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:41.838
Unice Harris: Your input is invaluable to the PROCESS, and it's gonna go a long ways in terms of

459
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.490
Unice Harris: Allow me to

460
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:53.059
Unice Harris: document that feedback. So my PROCESS will help, maybe

461
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.059
Unice Harris: help future and current practitioners

462
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.580
Unice Harris: to turn this epic

463
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:12.539
Unice Harris: amount of fail PROJECTs around. But give me a second. I'm gonna turn off the recording so we can catch up on other areas. 1 s. Here.

28

PARTICIPANT 6 what you're describing has been a standard PROCESS

37
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.440
PARTICIPANT 6 for for me, and my efforts.

38
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.319

39
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.200

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.760
PARTICIPANT 6 Sometimes join the

PARTICIPANT 6 PROJECT midstream, but in the beginning

42
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.800
PARTICIPANT 6 definitely and at the start of the next phase.

43
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.169
PARTICIPANT 6 engaging with the

44
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.770

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.759
PARTICIPANT 6 whether there is certainly has helped it.

50
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.850
PARTICIPANT 6 You could put it in terms of

51
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.090
PARTICIPANT 6 a compelling E or a burning platform.

52
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.749
PARTICIPANT 6 Why are we doing this, and what is in it for you?

53
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.479
PARTICIPANT 6 How do you BENEFIT? How does the ORGANIZATION BENEFIT. That has been a

54
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.610
PARTICIPANT 6 pretty standard

55
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.990
PARTICIPANT 6 PROCESS or

56
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.730
PARTICIPANT 6 most initiatives

57
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.270
PARTICIPANT 6 programs, efforts that I've worked on. And it starts with

58
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.280
PARTICIPANT 6 getting

59
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.070
PARTICIPANT 6 the

60
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.380
PARTICIPANT 6 leadership TEAM on board and

61
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.200
PARTICIPANT 6 trying to

62
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.500
PARTICIPANT 6 have a

63
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.220
PARTICIPANT 6 a CHAMPION

64
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.429
PARTICIPANT 6 from the executive suite. And then throughout the ORGANIZATION.

65
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.240
PARTICIPANT 6 developing those

66
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.489
PARTICIPANT 6 key influencers and the word

67
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.210
PARTICIPANT 6 CHANGE agents within

68
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.660
PARTICIPANT 6 the business unit or the the ORGANIZATION.

69
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:26.760
Unice Harris: Perfect. Thank you. And how did you communicate? That INFORMATION? Was it

70
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.450
Unice Harris: through

71
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.310
Unice Harris: a MEETING or some other method?

72
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.770
PARTICIPANT 6 It has taken multiple forms.

73
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.750
PARTICIPANT 6 It has

74
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:38.850
PARTICIPANT 6 been a

75
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.880
PARTICIPANT 6 one large engagement. There were a series of MEETINGS with all the directors

76
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.439
PARTICIPANT 6 and their units in the ORGANIZATION.

77
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.109
PARTICIPANT 6 And so it was a

78
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.510
PARTICIPANT 6 traveling show road. Show, if you will.

79
00:09:53.650 --> 00:10:01.240
PARTICIPANT 6 We went on the road describing why this was important, what it meant to the ORGANIZATION. So there's a presentation that was developed.

80
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.860
PARTICIPANT 6 And we went

81
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.110
PARTICIPANT 6 out and discuss this with

82
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.029
PARTICIPANT 6 each of those business units.

83
00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:10.809
PARTICIPANT 6 In addition, it was

84
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:19.710
PARTICIPANT 6 the COMMUNICATION that was sent to the entire ORGANIZATION. So there is EMAIL COMMUNICATION with NEWsletter.

85
00:10:21.252 --> 00:10:26.749
PARTICIPANT 6 That was updated frequently there was presentations, or there were presentations that were

86
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.530
PARTICIPANT 6 provided to those directors and leaders of those

87
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.690
PARTICIPANT 6 individual effectively

88
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.400
PARTICIPANT 6 ORGANIZATION. So there was COMMUNICATION across multiple

89
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.179
PARTICIPANT 6 forms or mechanisms.

90
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.030
PARTICIPANT 6 It was a

91
00:10:43.983 --> 00:10:49.959
PARTICIPANT 6 EMAIL. There was NEWsletter. There were target briefings, and there were

92
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.079
PARTICIPANT 6 other types of

93
00:10:53.147 --> 00:10:58.709
PARTICIPANT 6 lunch and learn, so that activities that was done to alert PEOPLE of what was coming down.

94
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.682
Unice Harris: Wonderful. Thank you for sharing that

95
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.160
Unice Harris: when you

96
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:13.110
Unice Harris: notified the ORGANIZATION of the PURPOSE. Do you feel like it

97
00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:18.580
Unice Harris: minimize confusion about the PURPOSE of the PROJECT.

98
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.970
PARTICIPANT 6 Wild

99
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:30.819
PARTICIPANT 6 it helped to, but there still was apprehension. Sometimes, if it's a major CHANGE, it may impact

100
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.530
PARTICIPANT 6 employees there.

101
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.459
PARTICIPANT 6 How they perform their work.

102
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:46.079
PARTICIPANT 6 So it did clearly state work hard to clearly state

103
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.920
PARTICIPANT 6 what is going to CHANGE and what those BENEFITS

104
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.332
PARTICIPANT 6 are going to be and what we're

105
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.830
PARTICIPANT 6 But there's a ongoing effort

106
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.750
PARTICIPANT 6 communicating

107
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.810
PARTICIPANT 6 often

108
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.889
PARTICIPANT 6 and in different forms to

109
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.440
PARTICIPANT 6 assuage any

110
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.860
PARTICIPANT 6 resistance, because

111
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.939
PARTICIPANT 6 but there, there is resistant.

112
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.050
PARTICIPANT 6 as there's a

113
00:12:14.842 --> 00:12:17.010
PARTICIPANT 6 so psychology to CHANGE.

114
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.400
Unice Harris: Absolutely.

115
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.080
PARTICIPANT 6 PEOPLE need to see something, and they

116
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.529
PARTICIPANT 6 they need to be close to it, to be able to feel that it's not going to be a negative. So

117
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.910
PARTICIPANT 6 Dip

118
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:34.279
PARTICIPANT 6 did help, and it does help. It helped in those cases. But there's still some doubters, and they sayers.

119
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.880
Unice Harris: Absolutely okay.

120
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.770
Unice Harris: Was there a time? And it doesn't have to be

121
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:50.820
Unice Harris: if there was a time. Can you also share time when you did not communicate the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION, the PURPOSE of PROJECT.

122
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.210
PARTICIPANT 6 No.

123
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:00.610
Unice Harris: Okay.

124
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.299
PARTICIPANT 6 And I cannot

125
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.780
PARTICIPANT 6 think of a time where

126
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.760
PARTICIPANT 6 it did not do that. Whether it was a major Erp

127
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.160
PARTICIPANT 6 perfect yeah, or

128
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.820
PARTICIPANT 6 other SYSTEM CHANGE.

129
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.500
PARTICIPANT 6 There was

130
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.290
PARTICIPANT 6 always COMMUNICATION

131
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.790
PARTICIPANT 6 with the

132
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.650
PARTICIPANT 6 affected

133
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.610
PARTICIPANT 6 business units

134
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.010
PARTICIPANT 6 or employees that were involved.

135
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:47.800
Unice Harris: Perfect question. Number 2 during the requirements or other phase of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION or PROJECT? Can you share how you informed cross functional TEAMS organ ORGANIZATION as a whole.

136
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:53.219
Unice Harris: of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically, and how it would affect

137
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.339
Unice Harris: or enhance how they do their work. So this question is along the lines of

138
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:12.576
Unice Harris: you know, how did you notify different DEPARTMENTs? And I think you answered that question quite profoundly in the first question. With the traveling road shows the EMAILS, the NEWsletters

139
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:22.109
Unice Harris: and would you like to further expound on that? And how that communicated to them how it would impact their day to day work.

140
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.580
PARTICIPANT 6 Yes, so

141
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.569
PARTICIPANT 6 just a few other thoughts there for

142
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.000
PARTICIPANT 6 hope.

143
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.729
PARTICIPANT 6 In one instance I was thinking about that.

144
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.219
PARTICIPANT 6 Tried to do this in more than one occasion.

145
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.513
PARTICIPANT 6 we would.

146
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.770
PARTICIPANT 6 demo

147
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.070
PARTICIPANT 6 the

148
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.859
PARTICIPANT 6 propose the

149
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.090
PARTICIPANT 6 SYSTEM.

150
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.340
PARTICIPANT 6 and

151
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.120
PARTICIPANT 6 look at what the business PROCESS is.

152
00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:01.309
PARTICIPANT 6 and the old SYSTEM, and how that would look in the NEW SYSTEM. So

153
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.169
PARTICIPANT 6 type of

154
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.490
PARTICIPANT 6 detailed

155
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.870
PARTICIPANT 6 work, flow.

156
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.359
PARTICIPANT 6 business PROCESS, presentation

157
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.539
PARTICIPANT 6 help. PEOPLE start to see

158
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.850
PARTICIPANT 6 things would CHANGE differently

159
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.190
PARTICIPANT 6 and also

160
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.729
PARTICIPANT 6 also brought in

161
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.640
PARTICIPANT 6 n, some

162
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.769
PARTICIPANT 6 key STAKEHOLDERS to demo.

163
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.540
PARTICIPANT 6 some of the or to review demos of the

164
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.970
PARTICIPANT 6 Nope

165
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.560
PARTICIPANT 6 NEW SYSTEMS.

166
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.819
PARTICIPANT 6 and how that

167
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.720
PARTICIPANT 6 TRANSFORMATION get impact

168
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.610
PARTICIPANT 6 the ORGANIZATION.

169
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.860
PARTICIPANT 6 So, but when it worked. This we had

170
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.670
PARTICIPANT 6 PEOPLE who were key leaders in the ORGANIZATION come in

171
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.320
PARTICIPANT 6 and see

172
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.329
PARTICIPANT 6 what that NEW SYSTEM, how that NEW SYSTEM would look.

173
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.040
PARTICIPANT 6 what those capabilities were.

174
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.690
PARTICIPANT 6 And in other cases

175
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.089
PARTICIPANT 6 we went. When we were developing

176
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.060
PARTICIPANT 6 business PROCESS, he actually went

177
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.489
PARTICIPANT 6 and discuss those

178
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.710
PARTICIPANT 6 business CHANGES with PEOPLE who were closest to the work.

179
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.780
Unice Harris: Okay.

180
00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:28.790
Unice Harris: that's great. The the whole demo concept is innovative. And that that's great. Did, do you feel like it minimized the confusion, and it helped them to understand a little bit more about their workflow.

181
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.600
PARTICIPANT 6 Oh, good.

182
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.899
PARTICIPANT 6 definitely. And we get good feedback on what they

183
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:42.330
PARTICIPANT 6 digging like, what they like and what they saw as positive. The Demos really help.

184
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.740
PARTICIPANT 6 They were in that

185
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.629
PARTICIPANT 6 schematics help. But then

186
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.070
PARTICIPANT 6 you actually

187
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.270
PARTICIPANT 6 and see

188
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.070
PARTICIPANT 6 a product of TECHNOLOGY

189
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.600
PARTICIPANT 6 that that worked as well.

190
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:05.429
Unice Harris: It makes me it makes a big difference. Is there a time when

191
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.790
Unice Harris: you didn't inform them of the same.

192
00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.999
Unice Harris: and there doesn't have to be.

193
00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:21.484
Unice Harris: but if there is a time, inform them of how would impact their day to day work?

194
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.560
PARTICIPANT 6 No.

195
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.489
Unice Harris: Okay.

196
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.819
PARTICIPANT 6 Always

197
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.280
PARTICIPANT 6 always discuss how the work will CHANGE.

198
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.830
PARTICIPANT 6 That became. And

199
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.560
PARTICIPANT 6 I've done this

200
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.270
PARTICIPANT 6 for a long time

201
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.660
PARTICIPANT 6 across

202
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.350
PARTICIPANT 6 many different platforms, initiatives, DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION and

203
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.789
PARTICIPANT 6 never rolled out anything developed

204
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.650
PARTICIPANT 6 implemented plan without

205
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.870
PARTICIPANT 6 discussing

206
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.999
PARTICIPANT 6 how that would impact

207
00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.409
PARTICIPANT 6 the PEOPLE who have.

208
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.010
Unice Harris: Perfect. Thank you.

209
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:11.099
Unice Harris: Question number 3 in the design phase, or any other phase before development of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION lifecycle.

210
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.130
Unice Harris: Can you share how you provide a TRAINING relative to the NEW PROCESS.

211
00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:31.529
Unice Harris: TECHNOLOGY or NEW TRANSFORMATION. Innovation. I know you talked about Demos and that sometimes can be a good method of TRAINING as well. You want it. Further expound on on that concept

212
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.230
Unice Harris: or any other TRAINING that was provided.

213
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.320
PARTICIPANT 6 Oath.

PARTICIPANT 6 I mean.

226
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.230
PARTICIPANT 6 and we're about

227
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.259
PARTICIPANT 6 so forming a demo. Could you ask the question again, please? Sorry.

228
00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:18.790
Unice Harris: In the design phase or any other phase before development.

229
00:19:19.378 --> 00:19:20.932
Unice Harris: Can you share

230
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.829
Unice Harris: how you provide a TRAINING relative to the NEW PROCESS or TECHNOLOGY.

231
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.060
PARTICIPANT 6 Oh, yes, yes.

232
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.636
PARTICIPANT 6 good raining.

233
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.030
PARTICIPANT 6 It certainly

234
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.630
PARTICIPANT 6 would be.

235
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.349
PARTICIPANT 6 She had a dedicated TRAINING TEAM.

236
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.820
PARTICIPANT 6 And the

237
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.850
PARTICIPANT 6 that develops

238
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.179
PARTICIPANT 6 TRAINING modules

239
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.760
PARTICIPANT 6 that align with each

240
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.630
PARTICIPANT 6 functional area.

241
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.405
PARTICIPANT 6 So

242
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:05.609
PARTICIPANT 6 the TRAINING? It's interesting, you said, during the design phase

243
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.220
PARTICIPANT 6 for weeks.

244
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.960
PARTICIPANT 6 the

245
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.840
PARTICIPANT 6 vendor

246
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.080
PARTICIPANT 6 who is usually providing the

247
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.210
PARTICIPANT 6 the product.

248
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.470
PARTICIPANT 6 Would have their TEAM come in and

249
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.750
PARTICIPANT 6 have some high level TRAINING.

250
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.640
PARTICIPANT 6 But the the detailed TRAINING and

251
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.900
PARTICIPANT 6 the approach was

252
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.250
PARTICIPANT 6 often more than once was

253
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.627
PARTICIPANT 6 train the trainer.

254
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.650
PARTICIPANT 6 so train a a cadre of

255
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.875
PARTICIPANT 6 the trainers and and then

256
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.060
PARTICIPANT 6 have

257
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:58.529
PARTICIPANT 6 TRAINING rolled out over time throughout. So it wasn't just one effort of TRAINING using

258
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.939
PARTICIPANT 6 have been multiple TRAINING. But starting with

259
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:13.880
PARTICIPANT 6 a a group of supervisory type trainers or or lead trainers who would then provide some additional TRAINING.

260
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.199
PARTICIPANT 6 But if

261
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.400
PARTICIPANT 6 what we found what I have found most effective isn't

262
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:30.560
PARTICIPANT 6 the knowledge, transfer or acquisition of that skill is more just in time TRAINING

263
00:21:31.354 --> 00:21:34.090
PARTICIPANT 6 close to the actual

264
00:21:36.208 --> 00:21:47.719
PARTICIPANT 6 SYSTEM. Cut over or go live the deployment implementation. While there's TRAINING along an awareness. There is right before

265
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.095
PARTICIPANT 6 going

266
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:57.030
PARTICIPANT 6 live with the SYSTEM. Then there'd be a additional TRAINING that would have it fresh in the TEAM's mind.

267
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.332
Unice Harris: Oh, that's great! Great, great! Thank you for sharing that.

268
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.169
Unice Harris: Was there a time that you didn't provide TRAINING.

269
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.060
PARTICIPANT 6 Oh.

270
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.149
PARTICIPANT 6 think about that. You'll see there with trade.

271
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.389
PARTICIPANT 6 I can't.

272
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:23.826
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah, I can't imagine a time when there wasn't TRAINING

273
00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.930
PARTICIPANT 6 sometime

274
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.140
PARTICIPANT 6 it may not have been as expensive.

275
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.269
PARTICIPANT 6 but there's always TRAINING, and

276
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.640
PARTICIPANT 6 sometimes it took different forms. Sometimes it's some

277
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.815
PARTICIPANT 6 self. Serve TRAINING

278
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.609
PARTICIPANT 6 and Bp type

279
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.600
PARTICIPANT 6 TRAINING. It was not always instructor. Led TRAINING.

280
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.249
Unice Harris: Right? Okay, perfect.

281
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.890
Unice Harris: Number 4

282
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.420
Unice Harris: in the TESTING phase.

283
00:23:05.179 --> 00:23:09.239
Unice Harris: can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS?

284
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:17.720
Unice Harris: I I don't know. Maybe a user acceptance test to confirm that it works the way it should or any other kind of TESTING.

285
00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.570
PARTICIPANT 6 Oh.

286
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.014
PARTICIPANT 6 yeah.

287
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.149
PARTICIPANT 6 there's always been. I can

288
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.850
PARTICIPANT 6 can't remember

289
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:35.809
PARTICIPANT 6 a time where we did not go through multiple phasing. May multiple phases

290
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.250
PARTICIPANT 6 TESTING

291
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.070
PARTICIPANT 6 at the

292
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.860
PARTICIPANT 6 at the design.

293
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.545
PARTICIPANT 6 fain.

294
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.850
Unice Harris: Some.

295
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.870
PARTICIPANT 6 Level of

296
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.419
PARTICIPANT 6 unit TESTING. And

297
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.990
PARTICIPANT 6 really, in the

298
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.379
PARTICIPANT 6 agile world. And

299
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.650
PARTICIPANT 6 you've been

300
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.200
PARTICIPANT 6 agile.

301
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.449
PARTICIPANT 6 Type concept

302
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.200
PARTICIPANT 6 have been used for a long time. We would call it

303
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.530
PARTICIPANT 6 rapid deployment. We

304
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:14.450
PARTICIPANT 6 you have red Chad type sessions that you bring in members of the TEAM.

305
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.600
PARTICIPANT 6 the

306
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.980
PARTICIPANT 6 user community who would participate.

307
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:24.430
PARTICIPANT 6 It wasn't always called agile bin. But that concept of getting

308
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.558
PARTICIPANT 6 user feedback on the development early on

309
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.580
PARTICIPANT 6 had

310
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.940
PARTICIPANT 6 been something I

311
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.030
PARTICIPANT 6 implemented

312
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.390
PARTICIPANT 6 who are used.

313
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.970
PARTICIPANT 6 deducted for

314
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.170
PARTICIPANT 6 most PROJECTs

315
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.820
PARTICIPANT 6 that

316
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.530
PARTICIPANT 6 unit back

317
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:53.700
PARTICIPANT 6 TESTING does it work by itself and integration TESTING? Does it work with the other modules and

318
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.140
PARTICIPANT 6 other types of SYSTEM test

319
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.560
PARTICIPANT 6 performance TESTING. All those types of TESTING have been done

320
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:11.469
PARTICIPANT 6 first definitely, for the most SUCCESSFUL applications have been performed with a a lot of time. Sometimes TESTING gets

321
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.760
PARTICIPANT 6 with.

322
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.409
PARTICIPANT 6 yeah, it like, Oh, wow.

323
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:25.009
PARTICIPANT 6 you know. Oh, we've got this. We got a 900 test scripts to develop. Who's gonna do that? We have time.

324
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.270
Unice Harris: Still becoming.

325
00:25:26.732 --> 00:25:29.047
PARTICIPANT 6 Becomes this mad scramble. And

326
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.480
PARTICIPANT 6 so.

327
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.500
PARTICIPANT 6 having adequate time for the

328
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.459
PARTICIPANT 6 UAT. Certainly.

329
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.920
PARTICIPANT 6 and

330
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.300
PARTICIPANT 6 in the

331
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:51.889
PARTICIPANT 6 more traditional predictive model, these stage gate reviews with leadership have occurred and more

332
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.420
PARTICIPANT 6 agile oriented environments and

333
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.040
PARTICIPANT 6 having them

334
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.880
PARTICIPANT 6 retrospective and

335
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.180
PARTICIPANT 6 demo

336
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.920
PARTICIPANT 6 right after a build or sprint, so that kind of

337
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.450
PARTICIPANT 6 user interaction

338
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.329
PARTICIPANT 6 product owner. Interaction

339
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.250
PARTICIPANT 6 has been

340
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.830
PARTICIPANT 6 easy part of the effort. Even with a a

341
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.669
PARTICIPANT 6 SYSTEM that hasn't

342
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.279
PARTICIPANT 6 doesn't require a lot of development. But there is some

343
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.939
PARTICIPANT 6 configuration. Oh, the

344
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.680
PARTICIPANT 6 user community

345
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.479
PARTICIPANT 6 STAKEHOLDERS have typically been part of

346
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.889
PARTICIPANT 6 how the

347
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.839
PARTICIPANT 6 SYSTEM is configured and then TESTING to do

348
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.330
PARTICIPANT 6 perform as

349
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.640
PARTICIPANT 6 designed.

350
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.799
Unice Harris: Great answer. Thank you.

351
00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:49.030
Unice Harris: Question number 5

352
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.599
Unice Harris: after the rollout into production.

353
00:26:51.630 --> 00:27:01.959
Unice Harris: how we're end users, employees, and STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback relative to what worked in production and what seemed not to work so smoothly.

354
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.420
PARTICIPANT 6 - yeah.

355
00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:07.870
PARTICIPANT 6 So

356
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.779
PARTICIPANT 6 yeah, that is

357
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.740
PARTICIPANT 6 food

358
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.760
PARTICIPANT 6 been ongoing

359
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.120
PARTICIPANT 6 with.

360
00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.460
PARTICIPANT 6 I'm thinking of one major effort. But

361
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.570
PARTICIPANT 6 user feedback

362
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.710
PARTICIPANT 6 have been

363
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.190
PARTICIPANT 6 for the best efforts this one in particular would

364
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.910
PARTICIPANT 6 actively solicited.

365
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.770
PARTICIPANT 6 because nothing

366
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.920
PARTICIPANT 6 great, if it works

367
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.530
PARTICIPANT 6 perfectly. But

368
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.260
PARTICIPANT 6 what I've

369
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.990
PARTICIPANT 6 seen and been

370
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.510
PARTICIPANT 6 part of. Now more. When you have a

371
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.860
PARTICIPANT 6 the major deployment released in

372
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.340
PARTICIPANT 6 like how the user

373
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.892
PARTICIPANT 6 feedback and you get the point where the dot releases

374
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.130
PARTICIPANT 6 2.1 2.1 point 2

375
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.220
PARTICIPANT 6 to address some of those bugs

376
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.761
PARTICIPANT 6 or fixes that have have come up.

377
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.969
Unice Harris: It's it's it's so reassuring to hear you talk about

378
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:31.460
Unice Harris: the 2 dot, one, the 2 dot, 2 to address those post production. Types of issues. Because a lot of times today, you know, they're just rolling these PROJECTs out. And they're not asking for feedback.

379
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:43.133
Unice Harris: And they're just left, you know, with whatever it is. And so it's just reassuring to hear you say those things. That's the way I've done it.

380
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:51.800
Unice Harris: And that's the way. I've proven to be SUCCESSFUL at it, but it's not always what you hear. So.

381
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.995
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah, no, yeah. It's it's good to hear that

382
00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:00.779
PARTICIPANT 6 units that that. How you've done it, certainly. In the best PROJECT that's happened.

383
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.379
PARTICIPANT 6 It happens it comes with a cost.

384
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:14.220
PARTICIPANT 6 because you have to have either trained staff or access to the vendor, or have built that into the contract, that there'll be that type of

385
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.010
PARTICIPANT 6 ongoing SUPPORT fitness.

386
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.000
PARTICIPANT 6 Not

387
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:25.950
PARTICIPANT 6 if you don't want to call it additional development that the O. And M. Sustainment part can

388
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.200
PARTICIPANT 6 can be a large part of the cost, as well of the effort.

389
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.530
Unice Harris: Totally. So let me ask you.

390
00:29:35.224 --> 00:29:55.429
Unice Harris: in those PROJECTs where you've conducted the TESTING, conducted the TRAINING advised them of their work roles. In addition to post post production feedback. Ha! Have those PROJECTs eventually

391
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.160
Unice Harris: increase revenue.

392
00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.380
PARTICIPANT 6 Hmm

393
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.000
PARTICIPANT 6 up

394
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.720
PARTICIPANT 6 in the

395
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.339
PARTICIPANT 6 and thinking of

396
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.310
PARTICIPANT 6 one case it

397
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.460
PARTICIPANT 6 and I will say, productivity increase.

398
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.220
Unice Harris: Okay.

399
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.307
PARTICIPANT 6 I will. Yes.

400
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.539
PARTICIPANT 6 I'm thinking about the REVENUEcomponent of whether that

401
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.710
PARTICIPANT 6 certainly

402
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.677
PARTICIPANT 6 I'm thinking about what metrics were being used to upset.

403
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.090
PARTICIPANT 6 in one case, yes, REVENUEwas increased

404
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.660
PARTICIPANT 6 in an

405
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.779
PARTICIPANT 6 in another case it was indirectly

406
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.550
PARTICIPANT 6 increase because the

407
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.900
PARTICIPANT 6 key metric

408
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.640
PARTICIPANT 6 weren't necessarily

409
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.370
PARTICIPANT 6 financial.

410
00:30:51.710 --> 00:31:06.319
PARTICIPANT 6 In another case it was. But typically, there's been a an improvement in work. So the indirect is through the increased productivity and the enhanced PROCESS.

411
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.815
PARTICIPANT 6 It's led to.

412
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.710
PARTICIPANT 6 Bob

413
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.220
PARTICIPANT 6 greater

414
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.220
PARTICIPANT 6 revenue.

415
00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.230
PARTICIPANT 6 The

416
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:20.169
PARTICIPANT 6 implementation itself, what may not have been designed for

417
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.370
PARTICIPANT 6 a REVENUEincrease.

418
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.529
PARTICIPANT 6 but through the

419
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:31.300
PARTICIPANT 6 increased efficiencies, the the PROCESS, improvement, the increased productivity.

420
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.290
PARTICIPANT 6 It led to

421
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:40.509
PARTICIPANT 6 more CUSTOMER SATISFACTION throughput. Even though that wasn't the

422
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.610
PARTICIPANT 6 the ultimate it wasn't the primary metric that was being addressed.

423
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.769
Unice Harris: Absolutely. Okay. Great great answer. Thank you. Question. Number 6,

424
00:31:52.930 --> 00:32:04.330
Unice Harris: can you share an example of a DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION that went very well? Also one that didn't go very well. And what did you do differently between the 2.

425
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.009
PARTICIPANT 6 One that didn't go well

426
00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.150
PARTICIPANT 6 is implementing A.

427
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.980
PARTICIPANT 6 A. Oh.

428
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:20.790
PARTICIPANT 6 holy

429
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.473
PARTICIPANT 6 8 Pm.

430
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:33.460
PARTICIPANT 6 Portfolio Program PROJECT MAANAGEMENT SYSTEM for an ORGANIZATION. And it with

431
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.004
PARTICIPANT 6 through. I say it didn't go well

432
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.170
PARTICIPANT 6 it went through 3 iterations

433
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.469
PARTICIPANT 6 before it was implemented.

434
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:47.799
PARTICIPANT 6 I call that not going well, because had several restarts.

435
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.030
PARTICIPANT 6 And part of it was

436
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.169
PARTICIPANT 6 I leadership SUPPORT?

437
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:05.799
PARTICIPANT 6 Yes, no. Sorry. I was choosing my first. Yes, sorry pocket was leadership SUPPORT.

438
00:33:06.481 --> 00:33:11.009
PARTICIPANT 6 There was a CHANGE in leadership. It wasn't always that the

439
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.489
PARTICIPANT 6 the TEAM didn't do something well to the

440
00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.089
PARTICIPANT 6 implementation of the development TEAM.

441
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.230
PARTICIPANT 6 But there was a CHANGE in leadership direction that impacted that SUCCESS.

442
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.510
PARTICIPANT 6 So there wasn't a commitment

443
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.310
PARTICIPANT 6 as it went from

444
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.490
PARTICIPANT 6 one leadership TEAM to the next.

445
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.000
PARTICIPANT 6 so

446
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.430
PARTICIPANT 6 what was done to help with that is to

447
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.560
PARTICIPANT 6 identify

448
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.540
PARTICIPANT 6 that initiative

449
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.110
PARTICIPANT 6 as a

450
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.360
PARTICIPANT 6 T

451
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.850
PARTICIPANT 6 performance metric

452
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.800
PARTICIPANT 6 for the ORGANIZATION.

453
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:58.430
PARTICIPANT 6 so that, regardless to who was in the leadership position that they would carry that view forward.

454
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:08.750
PARTICIPANT 6 Now, of course, you get a NEW leadership TEAM. You get a NEW strategic vision sometimes, but once we identify that as a key area, for the ORGANIZATION had that

455
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:14.309
PARTICIPANT 6 that type of SUPPORT from the board, then it made it easier for

456
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.610
PARTICIPANT 6 that one to go forward. I

457
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:23.410
PARTICIPANT 6 I've been in, and I say that was a one that wasn't a SUCCESS. But I've been involved in

458
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.019
PARTICIPANT 6 ORGANIZATIONs where that hasn't happened, where there has been a CHANGE of leadership.

459
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.670
PARTICIPANT 6 and where it

460
00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.799
PARTICIPANT 6 the PROJECT just died because it didn't have

461
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.909
PARTICIPANT 6 the the push and the CHAMPIONship from the executive level.

462
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:43.888
PARTICIPANT 6 I've been, and others that didn't.

463
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.820
PARTICIPANT 6 that didn't go well, another didn't go. Well, it's because of the

464
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.759
PARTICIPANT 6 the TECHNOLOGY

465
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:57.630
PARTICIPANT 6 was

466
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.090
PARTICIPANT 6 not mature. So we're

467
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.090
PARTICIPANT 6 the ORGANIZATION wasn't

468
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.970
PARTICIPANT 6 the ORGANIZATION

469
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:12.030
PARTICIPANT 6 maturity with the TECHNOLOGY, those 2 did not match they. The TEAM was not ready.

470
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:20.780
PARTICIPANT 6 So it wasn't that the TECHNOLOGY wasn't right. I misspoke. It's that the ORGANIZATION wasn't ready, mature enough

471
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.299
PARTICIPANT 6 to for this adoption. So

472
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:30.480
PARTICIPANT 6 the effort was a little ahead of where it should be. The the

473
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.760
PARTICIPANT 6 ORGANIZATION should have been

474
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.380
PARTICIPANT 6 prep

475
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.210
PARTICIPANT 6 sooner

476
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.480
PARTICIPANT 6 longer

477
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.060
PARTICIPANT 6 for the implementation.

478
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.409
PARTICIPANT 6 And so that's a lesson learned.

479
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.680
PARTICIPANT 6 and always

480
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.929
PARTICIPANT 6 get the field ready. Get the before engaging in the effort.

481
00:35:52.610 --> 00:36:00.790
Unice Harris: Absolutely. And that that happens a lot. You know, you can't just throw out TECHNOLOGY when

482
00:36:01.417 --> 00:36:12.870
Unice Harris: everybody that's using the TECHNOLOGY is not ready for it. There, could there? There's oftentimes TECHNOLOGY and culture or corporation mix mismatch

483
00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.250
Unice Harris: which leads to question number 7.

484
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:32.830
Unice Harris: Those types of situations. Can you share any activity that you would that you've taken to create a more DIGITAL innovation mindset within the ORGANIZATION. Has it helped or hurt their willingness to CHANGE.

485
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.359
PARTICIPANT 6 Hmm, yeah, that's a good question.

486
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.039
PARTICIPANT 6 And you started to touch on it

487
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.780
PARTICIPANT 6 when you mentioned culture.

488
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.433
PARTICIPANT 6 And.

489
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.099
PARTICIPANT 6 as many of us know, cultured trump strategy

490
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:54.799
PARTICIPANT 6 anywhere all the time. So

491
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.216
PARTICIPANT 6 it's one

492
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.810
PARTICIPANT 6 but

493
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.898
PARTICIPANT 6 learning the culture and establishing these early

494
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.009
PARTICIPANT 6 modules, I'll call them learning modules for the ORGANIZATION.

495
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.319
PARTICIPANT 6 To

496
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.409
PARTICIPANT 6 prep the feel for what's coming

497
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.440
PARTICIPANT 6 that

498
00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.849
PARTICIPANT 6 that takes time and it for one case

499
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.820
PARTICIPANT 6 out.

500
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.899
PARTICIPANT 6 We worked on this effort

501
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.650
PARTICIPANT 6 for

502
00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.769
PARTICIPANT 6 a better part of a year

503
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.570
PARTICIPANT 6 going around

504
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.020
PARTICIPANT 6 the world, literally.

505
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.090
PARTICIPANT 6 literally around the world.

506
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.330
PARTICIPANT 6 discussing

507
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.630
PARTICIPANT 6 what's coming

508
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.010
PARTICIPANT 6 that

509
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.250
PARTICIPANT 6 everyone needs to

510
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.530
PARTICIPANT 6 be prepared for the shift.

511
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:52.449
PARTICIPANT 6 We're going to be retiring the legacy SYSTEM. It was a whole

512
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.899
PARTICIPANT 6 series of events

513
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:56.270
PARTICIPANT 6 to

514
00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.510
PARTICIPANT 6 get the

515
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.480
PARTICIPANT 6 use, a community.

516
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.029
PARTICIPANT 6 if not comfortable.

517
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.940
PARTICIPANT 6 certainly aware that

518
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:15.370
PARTICIPANT 6 CHANGE is coming so in this instance that I'm I'm talking about

519
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:29.140
PARTICIPANT 6 if a few PEOPLE got antsy, well, okay. But others then became excited. Well, when's it? Gonna get here. We started hearing that in the environment and that let the leadership know that.

520
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.880
PARTICIPANT 6 hey, this is time to to move forward. There's

521
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.859
PARTICIPANT 6 certainly there's a developmental timeframe of

522
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:42.209
PARTICIPANT 6 you could just slam it and jam it in regardless. And PEOPLE gotta get ready for it.

523
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.580
PARTICIPANT 6 But this effort it was

524
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:51.562
PARTICIPANT 6 a different type of environment. They had more time. So there was a TEAM that was in place that was doing that

525
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.790
PARTICIPANT 6 that building effort, so that

526
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.379
PARTICIPANT 6 when it was time to actually start the

527
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.670
PARTICIPANT 6 the program, the PROJECT that they

528
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.800
PARTICIPANT 6 became ready. So it was a

529
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:09.460
PARTICIPANT 6 really a lot of field work, a lot of

530
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.930
PARTICIPANT 6 INFORMATION sharing awareness and

531
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.150
PARTICIPANT 6 trying to assuage PEOPLE that

532
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.070
PARTICIPANT 6 CHANGES

533
00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.970
PARTICIPANT 6 is coming. And it's

534
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.999
PARTICIPANT 6 not gonna be as

535
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.230
PARTICIPANT 6 disruptive as they might think. So.

536
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.430
Unice Harris: Great answer. Thank you. Question number 8

537
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.139
Unice Harris: after the rollout into production.

538
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:41.229
Unice Harris: How did the TRANSFORMATION, or did the TRANSFORMATION give you or the employees and STAKEHOLDERS the results that were expected.

539
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.620
Unice Harris: and if not, share and listen, learn.

540
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:54.440
PARTICIPANT 6 With so many examples. I'm thinking of

541
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.300
PARTICIPANT 6 So bear with me. Most

542
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.000
PARTICIPANT 6 have worked and have

543
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.595
PARTICIPANT 6 form

544
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.400
PARTICIPANT 6 at least

545
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.257
PARTICIPANT 6 with most BENEFIT

546
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.950
PARTICIPANT 6 who.

547
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.462
PARTICIPANT 6 I'm thinking so

548
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.129
Unice Harris: I can take your time.

549
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:28.760
PARTICIPANT 6 Deliver. Yes, that did not deliver as indicated. That's what we didn't get. The results.

550
00:40:29.376 --> 00:40:30.610
Unice Harris: Well, actually.

551
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.240
Unice Harris: so it's

552
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:44.320
Unice Harris: hey? I I'm asking after the rollout into production. How did it give you or the employees and STAKEHOLDERS the results that were expected.

553
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.380
Unice Harris: You know, when you finish that PROJECT.

554
00:40:47.500 --> 00:41:00.479
Unice Harris: Did it go as you expected? Did it deliver what you wanted it to deliver? Did? Were the STAKEHOLDER satisfied? Did they get what they wanted initially from the PROJECT.

555
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.760
PARTICIPANT 6 Oh.

556
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:10.039
PARTICIPANT 6 yeah, you know, I I mentioned the one

557
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.630
PARTICIPANT 6 that have the multiple

558
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.200
PARTICIPANT 6 starts

559
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.130
PARTICIPANT 6 that one. Eventually

560
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:25.020
PARTICIPANT 6 it performed well. But there was a related one where

561
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:31.460
PARTICIPANT 6 the NEW TECHNOLOGY. Let me, yeah, let me there. The NEW TECHNOLOGY, NEW SYSTEM

562
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:44.647
PARTICIPANT 6 did not. I'm thinking of one most have have gone well, because it's sort but one where it didn't

563
00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.275
PARTICIPANT 6 it didn't deliver.

564
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.890
PARTICIPANT 6 because there was another

565
00:41:53.525 --> 00:41:57.160
PARTICIPANT 6 SYSTEM that was being used for

566
00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.890
PARTICIPANT 6 HR.

567
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.749
PARTICIPANT 6 And that that that Hr. SYSTEM.

568
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.480
Unice Harris: Hmm.

569
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.440
PARTICIPANT 6 had a capability

570
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.960
PARTICIPANT 6 that vendor had a capability in that SYSTEM that could have SUPPORTed

571
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.080
PARTICIPANT 6 the other component.

572
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.430
PARTICIPANT 6 And

573
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.740
PARTICIPANT 6 there was some

574
00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.880
PARTICIPANT 6 buyers remote.

575
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.779
Unice Harris: Oh, gotcha

576
00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:30.880
PARTICIPANT 6 That. Oh, we could have used this other module of

577
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:35.278
PARTICIPANT 6 for capability functionality from the Hr.

578
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.680
PARTICIPANT 6 vendor.

579
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.520
PARTICIPANT 6 They had it similar. So

580
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.240
PARTICIPANT 6 while it it worked. Well, there was that

581
00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:44.550
PARTICIPANT 6 how

582
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.890
PARTICIPANT 6 buyers remorse, as I'm saying, where

583
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:51.890
PARTICIPANT 6 they

584
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.970
PARTICIPANT 6 are now thinking about

585
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.470
PARTICIPANT 6 implementing the

586
00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:02.999
PARTICIPANT 6 other capability from the Hr SYSTEM. So while it works. But

587
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.320
PARTICIPANT 6 they've spent money on implementing it.

588
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.180
PARTICIPANT 6 And now they are

589
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.699
PARTICIPANT 6 thinking about gaining some other efficiencies

590
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.860
PARTICIPANT 6 through

591
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:14.920
PARTICIPANT 6 the

592
00:43:17.515 --> 00:43:22.519
PARTICIPANT 6 internal integration of that Hr vendor product. So.

593
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.929
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah, and that kind of trade off analysis was

594
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.623
PARTICIPANT 6 discuss initially, but they made a different decision, and

595
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.639
PARTICIPANT 6 and then regretted it a little bit.

596
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.390
Unice Harris: Understood

597
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:45.270
Unice Harris: understood. And you always have that. You. Sometimes you get into those situations where

598
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:52.000
Unice Harris: you know there's buyers remorse, who they want something different than what they think they want. And

599
00:43:52.461 --> 00:44:03.810
Unice Harris: then they're dissatisfied with the selection that they make. So you know you, you get into that sometimes, and then a lot of times they know early on.

600
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:23.940
Unice Harris: They've gained the clarity that they need early on, and so they feel confident, and they can do it themselves. I I got what I need, this little tidbit of INFORMATION or this little tidbit of help, so I can do it myself. And then they suffer the consequences, or they suffer loss.

601
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:32.259
Unice Harris: and they have to come back and say, Oh, I really don't really know as much as I thought I kNEW, and I need your help with this.

602
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:36.118
PARTICIPANT 6 Please come back? Yes, for sure.

603
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:37.910
PARTICIPANT 6 And the.

604
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.389
Unice Harris: I get it? Last question.

605
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:56.289
Unice Harris: can you share why you think CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important or not important, and when we say CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. We mean COMMUNICATION. All the things that we've talked about COMMUNICATION. TRAINING.

606
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:59.390
PARTICIPANT 6 TRAINING. Yeah, sorry.

607
00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.099
PARTICIPANT 6 Yes, I'm I'm

608
00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.569
PARTICIPANT 6 part of the choir. Yeah, I'm I'm with you on that.

609
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.350
PARTICIPANT 6 But

610
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.760
PARTICIPANT 6 the initiative

611
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:10.810
PARTICIPANT 6 it

612
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:18.220
PARTICIPANT 6 I started to be very definitive. I'll just state it like that. Initiative won't be as SUCCESSFUL

613
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.329
PARTICIPANT 6 started to say, won't be SUCCESSFUL. It won't be as SUCCESSFUL sorry

614
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.550
PARTICIPANT 6 it can be most SUCCESSFUL

615
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:30.029
PARTICIPANT 6 with a robust Ocm effort. ORGANIZATIONal CHANGE MAANAGEMENT

616
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.759
PARTICIPANT 6 is an essential component

617
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.760
PARTICIPANT 6 of

618
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.280
PARTICIPANT 6 be

619
00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:42.120
PARTICIPANT 6 DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, the implementation, the SYSTEM enhancement, all of that.

620
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:48.209
PARTICIPANT 6 And I say that having worked across multiple programs and PROJECTs

621
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.440
PARTICIPANT 6 where

622
00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.930
PARTICIPANT 6 developing those

623
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:58.254
PARTICIPANT 6 CHANGE agents in the ORGANIZATION or identifying them.

624
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.920
PARTICIPANT 6 having those

625
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.450
PARTICIPANT 6 sessions where

626
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:05.870
PARTICIPANT 6 the user community feels comfortable.

627
00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:13.140
PARTICIPANT 6 With the CHANGE, or at least knowledgeable where they see how it impacts their work and what's in it for them.

628
00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.030
PARTICIPANT 6 Those kinds of efforts

629
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.730
PARTICIPANT 6 make the

630
00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:19.840
PARTICIPANT 6 TECHNOLOGY CHANGE

631
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.530
PARTICIPANT 6 more palatable.

632
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:25.639
PARTICIPANT 6 Obviously, PEOPLE have to get used to different SYSTEMS, different look and feel.

633
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:37.660
PARTICIPANT 6 but engaging those PEOPLE who are closest to the work, who have their hands on the keyboard, who look at the screen, getting their feedback early in the PROCESS.

634
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:53.644
PARTICIPANT 6 Is essential for the SUCCESS of the operation. In addition with that type of COMMUNICATION that you mentioned, where there's a ongoing discussion from

635
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:58.399
PARTICIPANT 6 leadership, but also others in the ORGANIZATION

636
00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.059
PARTICIPANT 6 can then serve as

637
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:02.835
PARTICIPANT 6 a

638
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.440
PARTICIPANT 6 a

639
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.644
PARTICIPANT 6 influencer. I use that term earlier. Who can

640
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:18.800
PARTICIPANT 6 share the goodness that is coming. I I don't see how it works without it matter of fact, when it. When that doesn't happen.

641
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:38.859
PARTICIPANT 6 I think you get pushback and you get disgruntled employees and some environments may not care. And they say, Well, you gotta do this anyway. This is now your job, and this is the SYSTEM that we have the best run companies, the best implementation, engage the employees, engage leadership through multiple levels of the ORGANIZATION and

642
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.639
PARTICIPANT 6 are always

643
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:44.409
PARTICIPANT 6 communicating with them that what's happening so that there's

644
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.640
PARTICIPANT 6 less of a culture shock.

645
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:52.130
Unice Harris: absolutely, absolutely. Thank you very much. I,

646
00:47:52.845 --> 00:47:56.299
Unice Harris: see that a lot. I

647
00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:03.650
Unice Harris: have consulted for many many years, with multiple different ORGANIZATIONs, and

648
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:06.100
Unice Harris: what comes to mind is

649
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:13.640
Unice Harris: an ORGANIZATION I was working with, and they were big on agile. They brought me in to

650
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:24.350
Unice Harris: shore up their Pmo or redesign their Pmo. Because they had implemented everything with agile, every single PROJECT with agile, and

651
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:32.069
Unice Harris: something happened with 2 of their big government and banking SYSTEM clients

652
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:42.300
Unice Harris: the I think it was health and human services came in, and they wanted to know why something some big

653
00:48:44.610 --> 00:49:02.879
Unice Harris: criteria or government mandate was not met, and all they had was a backlog and some scripts. You know, they didn't have a charter. They didn't have a design development document. They there was no way for them to trace that.

654
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.660
Unice Harris: You know what what happened

655
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:18.030
Unice Harris: and why that government mandate wasn't met because they didn't have any type of structure other than just the backlog and the spritz. So they dive right in

656
00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:32.831
Unice Harris: and it was oh, it was. It was a heinous situation. So and then another one. The sec came in. It was a big financial regulated ORGANIZATION, and they had fines.

657
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:53.859
Unice Harris: because of some criteria or regulation hadn't been met from a financial standpoint, and then all they had was again the backlog and some sprints and the release schedule and they didn't have the nuts and the bolts. They didn't have the requirements document

658
00:49:53.860 --> 00:50:04.910
Unice Harris: to say, Okay, where this requirement come from, you know. So we're able to trace back what the requirement were. So we can identify what we missed and why these

659
00:50:05.537 --> 00:50:08.760
Unice Harris: Government mandates were not met. So

660
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.169
Unice Harris: they brought me in to

661
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:15.660
Unice Harris: revise their Pmo.

662
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.150
Unice Harris: And I was able to

663
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:44.080
Unice Harris: let them keep the agile PROCESS, but to build in some additional structure to it, so that for those PROJECTs where that are heavily regulated. They have that CHANGE MAANAGEMENT component in there where they're telling them. Here are the requirements. Here's the PROJECT. Charter. Here's the TRAINING here all these things, so that

664
00:50:44.080 --> 00:51:01.530
Unice Harris: if something happens on the back end where a customer's financial accounts are impacted, you're able to go back and say, Oh, we missed this at the requirements. It was never in the design document, you know, as opposed to just having a backlog and some sprints.

665
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:13.043
Unice Harris: you know. So it's it's wonderful that you're able to say that. You know Ocm is an essential component, because you know, most of my PROJECTs.

666
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.360
Unice Harris: have succeeded where I've been able to build

667
00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:22.609
Unice Harris: that component into it. So yeah, any questions.

668
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:23.430
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah.

669
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.569
Unice Harris: For me, or the study in general.

670
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:33.060
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah, no, thank you. And thank you for sharing a little bit about your background. I just wanted to know a little bit more about

671
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.040
PARTICIPANT 6 you, how you got to it, what!

672
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:40.630
PARTICIPANT 6 What is motivating you towards your your study? And

673
00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.000
PARTICIPANT 6 where are you?

674
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:43.960
PARTICIPANT 6 Just?

675
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.930
PARTICIPANT 6 Who is Eunice? Please.

676
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:59.340
Unice Harris: Absolutely so. I have been a certified PROJECT manager for since 2,005 I started my career at a company called Honeywell.

677
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.310
Unice Harris: and.

678
00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.040
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah.

679
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:05.989
Unice Harris: Yep and they were. I was on the home security side.

680
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:19.779
Unice Harris: and we were on this nationwide implementation. I was early in my twenties. Excited traveling all over the world. And at that time I was a software conversion specialist.

681
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.040
Unice Harris: And when the PROJECT started to go over budget.

682
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:44.859
Unice Harris: I started thinking, wow, there has to be a better way to do this. And it seemed like their PROJECT manager program managers. They were all over the place, not structured not really following the budget. There were multiple different things that I noticed. And I said, Well, I can do better. I think I could do better as a Pm.

683
00:52:44.860 --> 00:53:01.416
Unice Harris: so then I start looking into PROJECT MAANAGEMENT and program MAANAGEMENT. And then I took I start taking classes, and then getting those positions as Pm. And then I took my Pmp certification in 2,005 and

684
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:31.209
Unice Harris: moved into the PROJECT MAANAGEMENT space, then into the program MAANAGEMENT space then into the Pmo officer space. And you know, now I'm a Vp over a Pmo for a small ORGANIZATION. And what I'm seeing within the industry is disturbing. Per se you know, I did the research investigation. And I know that more than 70

685
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.020
Unice Harris: of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROJECTs. They're failing

686
00:53:35.744 --> 00:53:42.169
Unice Harris: and a lot of money is being lost. Based upon, you know.

687
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:46.983
Unice Harris: partially because we're not building in the CHANGE MAANAGEMENT.

688
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:49.210
Unice Harris: we're rolling out

689
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:57.610
Unice Harris: NEW TECHNOLOGY. And I'll use this as an example. In 2,020, I believe.

690
00:53:58.054 --> 00:54:03.520
Unice Harris: I was working on a particular health related PROJECT, and it was an important thing.

691
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:11.039
Unice Harris: and they rolled out this PROJECT, and they brought me in to fix the, to fix the madness

692
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:11.940
Unice Harris: and

693
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.050
Unice Harris: When I got in, the

694
00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:17.980
Unice Harris: workers were livid.

695
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:24.470
Unice Harris: they were furious. The STAKEHOLDERS were furious. And they were basically saying.

696
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:41.309
Unice Harris: they push this TECHNOLOGY onto us. Our customers are suffering because we don't know how to use this TECHNOLOGY. They asked us to test the TECHNOLOGY and train on it. But we don't even know anything about the TECHNOLOGY, and that was foreign to me.

697
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:45.079
Unice Harris: That that was I did not know

698
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.580
Unice Harris: that anyone

699
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.360
PARTICIPANT 6 ORGANIZATIONs are doing that. Huh? Yeah.

700
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.099
Unice Harris: I had never seen it before.

701
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.120
PARTICIPANT 6 Figure it out.

702
00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.020
Unice Harris: Exactly. And that's what they did. They rolled out this TECHNOLOGY. They spent

703
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:31.030
Unice Harris: 17 million dollars on this TECHNOLOGY and they just rolled it out, and they were failing miserably because their end users didn't know how to use the TECHNOLOGY. So when their customers came, called in to get assistance, their end. Users were scrambling on the phone trying to figure out how to use the TECHNOLOGY. And it just didn't click to them. Hey, you've gotta train them on how to use this before you just roll it out.

704
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:33.203
PARTICIPANT 6 Wow, yeah.

705
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:34.980
Unice Harris: So.

706
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:46.600
PARTICIPANT 6 Just switching gears. I cause I know you you may. I don't know if you have other interviews or your time you guys allotted, and I know you're still recording. But please why, Cappella.

707
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.742
Unice Harris: But you know

708
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.460
Unice Harris: that's a good question.

709
00:55:52.840 --> 00:56:04.532
Unice Harris: I am busy. I have a really really busy schedule. And I thought, Wow, someone that I kNEW was working on a degree from Capella, and

710
00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:11.200
Unice Harris: I looked into it. I took the program. I compared its

711
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:16.589
Unice Harris: and Mba program and its doctorate program to all the leading schools.

712
00:56:17.108 --> 00:56:23.810
Unice Harris: I compared it to Stanford. I compared it to other major schools.

713
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:35.599
Unice Harris: and it was comparable. The only difference is that Cappella was online, and that was a better option for me as opposed to going and sitting in a classroom.

714
00:56:36.155 --> 00:56:51.810
Unice Harris: So that was my deciding factor. One. It was accredited to. The curriculum was just as competitive as the 3 or 4 major schools that I compared it to.

715
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.000
Unice Harris: So.

716
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.451
PARTICIPANT 6 Yeah, gotcha, yeah. And.

717
00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:59.086
Unice Harris: I'm not at all disappointed.

718
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:04.290
PARTICIPANT 6 That's what I was gonna say, and how have you enjoyed it? So it sounds like you do. But good, yeah.

719
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.259
Unice Harris: And let me get us off. This recording hang on 1 s.








Participant 7

WEBVTT

1
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.800
Unice Harris: Good afternoon.

2
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.979
PARTICIPANT 7Can you hear me?

3
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.810
Unice Harris: Yeah, I can hear you.

4
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.240
PARTICIPANT 7Okay, perfect.

5
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.210
Unice Harris: Thank you for joining Myra. I appreciate your input into the study.

6
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:21.679
Unice Harris: and I know you have so much experience. I just thought, oh, I can't wait to hear her answers to some of these questions. I know your

7
00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:25.970
Unice Harris: experience and expertise will be invaluable to the study.

8
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.640
Unice Harris: Any questions before I get started.

9
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:40.970
PARTICIPANT 7No, I did have opportunity to kind of look over some of the questions. So I am. I'm ready. I'll just rely solely on your experience and

10
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.010
PARTICIPANT 7how things have transpired for me into the DIGITAL world.

11
00:06:48.398 --> 00:07:16.340
Unice Harris: Sounds good. Just give me your honest experience and opinions on each of the questions that, and that's it. So I'll just go ahead and start with question number one during the initiation or other phase or start of the PROJECT. Can you share time when you communicate the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION, and how it would enhance or help the ORGANIZATION.

12
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.830
PARTICIPANT 7Okay?

13
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:26.839
PARTICIPANT 7well, there was one time when I actually, I'll use implementing salesforce.

14
00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:31.184
PARTICIPANT 7As an example I shared. How

15
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.210
PARTICIPANT 7That CHANGE could the company could capitalize off of

16
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.709
PARTICIPANT 7implementing salesforce.

17
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.960
Unice Harris: With.

18
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.560
PARTICIPANT 7All the salesforce has, like a DIGITAL journey that helps you

19
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.995
PARTICIPANT 7electronically, send out

20
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:58.759
PARTICIPANT 7reminders. Or, for instance, I'll use the example of someone given birth.

21
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:10.011
PARTICIPANT 7It gives. It'll trigger EMAILS at certain points for to send to the the parents certain phases of their

22
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:29.750
PARTICIPANT 7pregnancy. So I like to use that as an example. Analogy that I share with the company. This is how we can bring about the CHANGE using salesforce. I know the company tried to implement it, for, like 5 years prior to me, coming on board.

23
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.310
Unice Harris: Okay.

24
00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:33.690
PARTICIPANT 7So there was a lot of resistance there.

25
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.240
PARTICIPANT 7But when I when I was trying to share the BENEFITS of it.

26
00:08:40.039 --> 00:09:00.739
PARTICIPANT 7There was resistance, but again, like I was sharing some of the BENEFITS to that would be. No one has to remember to send it out in the first trimester to send an EMAIL out to the in the first trimester, or the second, or the third. This is part of the journey that's already

27
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:18.699
PARTICIPANT 7pre triggered at a certain time. It's scheduled to go out to the parents and say, Hey, this is the phase that you're in, and these are the things that you are experiencing? Are you prepared for? You know certain items?

28
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:38.830
PARTICIPANT 7Do you have certain items? And are you prepared for this phase? And it'll provide a list of items that the parents will need during this time. So as I was explaining that to the company, the TEAM STAKEHOLDERS that needed to make the decision whether we were moving forward with it.

29
00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:41.920
PARTICIPANT 7There was some resistance.

30
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.090
PARTICIPANT 7because

31
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.885
PARTICIPANT 7again, CHANGE. You know, everyone's not

32
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:56.359
PARTICIPANT 7happy about CHANGE, and it had been like I said they had tried to implement it for 5 years, and it was unSUCCESSFUL. So

33
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.840
PARTICIPANT 7we were trying to figure out.

34
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:05.599
PARTICIPANT 7You know how to persuade everyone to get on board to try it. One more time.

35
00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:06.993
Unice Harris: So,

36
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.330
PARTICIPANT 7I think.

37
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:18.470
Unice Harris: How did you communicate that to everyone? Was it? What what mo or media did you use to communicate all of that.

38
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.619
PARTICIPANT 7So I actually

39
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.159
PARTICIPANT 7had the company come in and actually

40
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.939
PARTICIPANT 7do a presentation for us and show us how we can. They did. This was all

41
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.253
PARTICIPANT 7DIGITAL. They were showing us how it would play out

42
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.970
PARTICIPANT 7and they went through their total app through the salesforce app to share. This is how it will work.

43
00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:49.120
PARTICIPANT 7And I think that was a big part in persuing

44
00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:54.938
PARTICIPANT 7the others, because they were able to see the whole journey. It was like a

45
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.230
PARTICIPANT 7a diagram with each

46
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:07.179
PARTICIPANT 7phase, and what was going to take place, and how we get triggered. So I think that was the persuasion place. So we had the internal MEETING. First. I share what

47
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.404
PARTICIPANT 7Salesforce had shared with me, and that I wanted to bring them in and have them do a presentation

48
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.550
PARTICIPANT 7for the TEAM. And so that's how we were able to get

49
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.649
PARTICIPANT 7get the TEAM to BUYINto it, at least to look at it.

50
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:30.169
Unice Harris: Okay, and there doesn't have to be a time. But I'm gonna ask you, anyway, can you can you share a time

51
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:40.060
Unice Harris: when you didn't communicate the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION. Again, there doesn't have to be a time, but if there was a time, can you share.

52
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:52.270
PARTICIPANT 7I can't think of one where I didn't communicate right off the top. But as we go through the interview, if anything comes back to me from my early stages. Then I will

53
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.679
PARTICIPANT 7come back to it.

54
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.869
Unice Harris: With the heck.

55
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.949
Unice Harris: Okay, perfect. Thank you for sharing that. Question. Number 2

56
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:11.599
Unice Harris: during the requirements or any other phase of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you informed cross functional TEAMS or the ORGANIZATION as a whole.

57
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.460
Unice Harris: of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically.

58
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.630
Unice Harris: and how it would impact, or affect

59
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.290
Unice Harris: or enhance the way they do their work.

60
00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:28.305
PARTICIPANT 7So just overall. I think there was a time.

61
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.740
PARTICIPANT 7and this is probably I'll use the same example, because this is very challenging.

62
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:39.519
PARTICIPANT 7But there was a time. Part of implementing salesforce. You have to

63
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.329
PARTICIPANT 7enter the data. You have to load the data 14 weeks

64
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.940
PARTICIPANT 7prior to use.

65
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.689
PARTICIPANT 7because so this I guess, this goes back to a time where it was missed, where we

66
00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.140
PARTICIPANT 7did not communicate effectively that we had. There was a 14 week

67
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.175
PARTICIPANT 7requirement to have the data loaded. So that goes back to

68
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.780
Unice Harris: The question.

69
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:17.000
PARTICIPANT 7That I was trying to think about. So because it's a hard requirement with salesforce that they need the data in 14 weeks.

70
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:29.580
PARTICIPANT 7We did not want to wait 14 weeks to figure out that. Okay, the data could be loaded. Good. And maybe it's not so what my recommendation was. Let's proceed with loading the data.

71
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:38.230
PARTICIPANT 7Let's act as if anything. There, we don't. Don't have anything wrong with the data. It's all correct.

72
00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:41.660
PARTICIPANT 7If we do not find

73
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.480
PARTICIPANT 7any major

74
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.950
PARTICIPANT 7issues, we'll go ahead and move forward with the implementation.

75
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.480
PARTICIPANT 7and if we do find.

76
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.570
PARTICIPANT 7you know a flaw, but it's not really a show stopper. Then we would

77
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.810
PARTICIPANT 7implement a phase 2

78
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:19.109
PARTICIPANT 7because we don't wanna sit around talking our thumbs, or, you know, TESTING, waiting for Qa. To finish before TEAM weeks and then figure out, oh, there's nothing wrong. So we proceeded to implement as if the data was loaded correctly that we were not gonna have any issues.

79
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:32.760
PARTICIPANT 7and we had a hard stop we were going with. We had what was called open season, so we had a hard stop in October, and I think we started this in January, but there were certain other requirements that needed to be completed

80
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.000
PARTICIPANT 7prior to

81
00:14:36.013 --> 00:14:46.170
PARTICIPANT 7the Qa TESTING. So we had to move forward with what is called a happy path, like everything's gonna work correctly.

82
00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:51.469
PARTICIPANT 7We didn't know it, but the way that I continue to share with them.

83
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.660
PARTICIPANT 7even if we don't

84
00:14:53.963 --> 00:14:59.709
PARTICIPANT 7move forward with it. Then we're just sitting there, and we will not be able to use it for open season.

85
00:15:00.694 --> 00:15:06.465
PARTICIPANT 7So. But we just had to weigh the outcome. Is it gone to?

86
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:16.099
PARTICIPANT 7Which way is gonna be? It's going to impact the company most. If we sit there and wait, do nothing, or if we move forward as if everything works.

87
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.659
PARTICIPANT 7and we plan to have a phase 2.

88
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.474
PARTICIPANT 7If there are no major

89
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:35.780
PARTICIPANT 7defects in which I got all the STAKEHOLDERS to BUYINto moving forward. So we didn't move forward. We didn't have any major issues. We had a couple like, you know, nice 2 halves.

90
00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:40.768
PARTICIPANT 7Which we're not show stoppers. So we move forward with the implementation

91
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:53.320
PARTICIPANT 7and like, I said, they tried to get this implemented in like 4 or 5 years before, and we were able to get it implemented within a year. But we move forward with noted risk.

92
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.950
Unice Harris: Okay.

93
00:15:56.809 --> 00:16:01.800
Unice Harris: and you were able to get the shareholders on board.

94
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:19.180
Unice Harris: when that tool salesforce did it impact multiple different DEPARTMENTs? Or did it? Just were you rolling it out? For just one DEPARTMENT? And then, if you were rolling it out where it impacted multiple different DEPARTMENTs.

95
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:38.030
Unice Harris: was there ever a COMMUNICATION like right upfront at the start on how it would BENEFIT them, or did salesforce when you brought them into the ORGANIZATION? Did they clarify how how it would BENEFIT each of the ORGANIZATIONs, each of the DEPARTMENTs.

96
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.040
PARTICIPANT 7Yes, so it more so BENEFITed the marketing group.

97
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.790
PARTICIPANT 7but because the marketing group

98
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.820
PARTICIPANT 7was

99
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.980
PARTICIPANT 7SUPPORTed by so many other ORGANIZATIONs across

100
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.910
PARTICIPANT 7cross functional.

101
00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:01.069
PARTICIPANT 7We didn't realize that until salesforce came in and actually did their demo.

102
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:24.609
PARTICIPANT 7How many DEPARTMENTs were impacted. So we did have to start pulling different DEPARTMENTs in once we had already start the PROCESS. So I think that's kinda answering your question, too. We were impacted other groups, but they were not notified at the beginning, but we were able to pull them in in time, where they could still tell us

103
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.660
PARTICIPANT 7what some of their requirements were.

104
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.480
Unice Harris: Okay, follow that.

105
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.660
PARTICIPANT 7Before we were too deep into the

106
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.360
PARTICIPANT 7implementation.

107
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.140
Unice Harris: Okay, okay.

108
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:45.299
Unice Harris: question number 3 in the design phase or any other phase before development of the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION lifecycle. Can you share how you provide a TRAINING

109
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.180
Unice Harris: relative to the NEW PROCESS, TECHNOLOGY or NEW TRANSFORMATION.

110
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.590
PARTICIPANT 7Yes, so we did start

111
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.859
PARTICIPANT 7bringing in salesforce. So part of

112
00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:07.480
PARTICIPANT 7where what they offer was TRAINING on their tools, what to expect how to use them. They work with the development TEAM.

113
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.180
PARTICIPANT 7There work. They worked with our business analyst.

114
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.460
PARTICIPANT 7And

115
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:22.100
PARTICIPANT 7just basically on how the function is gonna work, what needs to any prerequisites

116
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.459
PARTICIPANT 7that needed to be in place for the development TEAM.

117
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.840
PARTICIPANT 7so I think that was the the TRAINING that was needed to get everyone on board. They were.

118
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.120
PARTICIPANT 7They kNEW these things ahead of time, and then, once it was implemented.

119
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:52.009
PARTICIPANT 7the salesforce TEAM still stayed, involved for a certain period of time to make sure, and worked alongside of our developers in the business to make sure that we had a smooth transition into production.

120
00:18:52.010 --> 00:19:00.110
Unice Harris: Okay? And do you feel like that minimize confusion about how the solution would impact or CHANGE how they worked.

121
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:06.494
PARTICIPANT 7Absolutely. And we would have multiple MEETINGS, weekly MEETINGS, sometimes more than once,

122
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.349
PARTICIPANT 7to ensure that

123
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.279
PARTICIPANT 7all all the data was implemented correctly and

124
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.740
PARTICIPANT 7The TEAMS were trained.

125
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.750
PARTICIPANT 7so it definitely made a difference.

126
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.310
Unice Harris: Okay.

127
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.480
PARTICIPANT 7And minimize the impact.

128
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.450
Unice Harris: Okay.

129
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.950
Unice Harris: Can you share a time when you didn't provide any TRAINING at all?

130
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.909
Unice Harris: It doesn't have.

131
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.239
PARTICIPANT 7It would be.

132
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.319
Unice Harris: Yeah, time. But if there is a time, can you share.

133
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:46.880
PARTICIPANT 7No, I always. I'm pretty sure that we always provided TRAINING because the CHANGE is already difficult for individuals. So I can't think of a time where TRAINING was not provided.

134
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.060
Unice Harris: Okay?

135
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.703
Unice Harris: Good, perfect.

136
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:59.329
Unice Harris: question. Number 4 in the TESTING phase of the TRANSFORMATION lifecycle. Can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or PROCESS.

137
00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:18.270
PARTICIPANT 7Yeah, sure. So the Qa TEAM would work with. We started bringing because I have a Qa background as well. I realize that we have to bring the Qa TEAM in actually, early at the beginning versus the end, because they actually

138
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.390
PARTICIPANT 7can see

139
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:28.230
PARTICIPANT 7or no SYSTEMS that are being hit, and how the whole PROCESS works, so they can kind of tell us

140
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.550
PARTICIPANT 7where the checks and balances need to be.

141
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.659
PARTICIPANT 7So we would create journeys to

142
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.139
PARTICIPANT 7test, and, you know, write scripts cases

143
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.864
PARTICIPANT 7to actually make sure the journeys were hitting each

144
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.080
PARTICIPANT 7space that they needed to hit and test

145
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.319
PARTICIPANT 7and make sure our our trigger event at a certain point.

146
00:20:57.393 --> 00:21:01.756
PARTICIPANT 7So they would write test cases to make sure if you know

147
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:07.449
PARTICIPANT 7if it's at 3 months, which EMAIL is being sent out if it. You know.

148
00:21:08.023 --> 00:21:20.610
PARTICIPANT 7for instance, this is kind of tragic. But if is this? The pregnancy was terminated, or for whatever reason, maybe the mom lost the baby that we would not continue to send

149
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:33.079
PARTICIPANT 7those EMAILS and reminders of certain things. So all of that was part of the test. But those are test cases, and those test cases were all usually put in Jira and

150
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.590
PARTICIPANT 7converted over.

151
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.330
Unice Harris: That's okay.

152
00:21:36.227 --> 00:21:41.150
Unice Harris: So that's good. Because you know you you wouldn't want a situation where

153
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:48.959
Unice Harris: that would be very traumatizing to have someone to lose their child, and then get an EMAIL, you know.

154
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.770
PARTICIPANT 7Yeah, my members.

155
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.430
Unice Harris: So.

156
00:21:51.238 --> 00:21:55.469
PARTICIPANT 7And see, those are things that are automatically

157
00:21:55.550 --> 00:22:00.912
PARTICIPANT 7communicated with the DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. No. One has to remember the

158
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.530
PARTICIPANT 7with everything being digitized is gonna automatically pick up

159
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:22.980
PARTICIPANT 7that it was terminated so, and that the medical records are there too. They're connected with all of the journey that's being sent out to the parents. So that makes a big difference. There's less room for era.

160
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.960
PARTICIPANT 7Yep.

161
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.966
Unice Harris: I agree?

162
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:34.690
Unice Harris: and you may not have one. But can you also share a time where you didn't test a SYSTEM or a NEW TRANSFORMATION?

163
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.169
PARTICIPANT 7Yeah. So there's times. Because if

164
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:57.640
PARTICIPANT 7you know, for well, maybe PEOPLE don't know, but usually TESTING is always the one that has less time. You say you need 2 months. You probably would be good to get, you know, to get half of that time. So TESTING is always shortened. You just document

165
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.469
PARTICIPANT 7depending on what it is because

166
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.769
PARTICIPANT 7a lot of times you have to go to market pretty quick. Everything is a race to market to be the first.

167
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:29.599
PARTICIPANT 7So you document pretty early and share. You know these are the risks that we're gonna take, and then the STAKEHOLDERS will try to, or you will try to get the STAKEHOLDERS to BUYIN to say, we're just gonna test at this level, and then we'll go back and continue TESTING so most of the part, most of the time you hit

168
00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:39.109
PARTICIPANT 7the things that you want to ensure is working. That is a show stopper, you know there's a lot of want to have.

169
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:48.409
PARTICIPANT 7but then there are must haves as well, so as long as the must haves are working, then sometimes you can get the STAKEHOLDERS to.

170
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:49.730
PARTICIPANT 7Agree

171
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:56.980
PARTICIPANT 7to go back and continue TESTING on the once. Nice to have rather.

172
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.529
Unice Harris: And do you feel like that? Minimize confusion? Because sometimes

173
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:22.560
Unice Harris: in in today's landscape, you know you. You see those like you said first to market. Is important to everyone, until PEOPLE just kind of throw things out there, and then figure out that it doesn't work when, after it's blown up, and the customer is losing money. So in your.

174
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.150
PARTICIPANT 7Okay.

175
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:34.579
Unice Harris: When you implemented the test, did you feel like it helped the implementation. And did it minimize confusion about you know how things should work.

176
00:24:36.213 --> 00:24:57.059
PARTICIPANT 7I do. I feel like it definitely minimized it. And I feel like, because we have been down or the company had been down that road so many times that they were more apt to follow and listen to what the Qa. TEAM was saying has to be tested. So I think that minimized a lot of the

177
00:24:57.838 --> 00:25:01.281
PARTICIPANT 7stress and anxiety and

178
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.470
PARTICIPANT 7just gave them opportunity to say, Okay, if we listen in, we

179
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:18.760
PARTICIPANT 7test this, these must have. Then we will come out on the other side. It's less likely that we'll come out with any issues at the end of the implementation.

180
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:19.900
Unice Harris: Okay?

181
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.809
Unice Harris: Question number 5

182
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:30.779
Unice Harris: after the rollout into production. How were end users, employees, or STAKEHOLDERS allowed to offer feedback

183
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.960
Unice Harris: relative to what worked in production, and what seemed not to work so smoothly.

184
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:48.630
PARTICIPANT 7Yeah. So that's a good question. We would actually do a debrief after we're after the implementation. Immediately, you know, when we implement into production.

185
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:57.890
PARTICIPANT 7The business would test, and Qa TEAM would be their TESTING. And just make sure that the functionality is

186
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:17.159
PARTICIPANT 7working as designed. So once we say, okay, it's working as designed. But then we would like to have. That's when we would have the next call or MEETING which would debrief about what could we do different? What do we want to CHANGE? And that's where we would start making

187
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:36.999
PARTICIPANT 7NEW making plans to implement those CHANGES. So that kind of would be our phase 2. But at that time they'll have opportunity to say, Yeah, this is what the requirement was. But this is what we really meant. And this is what we would like to hide. So at that point we can make any CHANGES form in the next phase.

188
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:50.520
Unice Harris: Okay. And then, after you receive that feedback from them, did it seem like they were more receptive to CHANGE or hesitant to CHANGE, and did the PROJECT eventually increase revenue.

189
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.482
PARTICIPANT 7I do feel like they were more receptive to CHANGE at that point.

190
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:02.779
PARTICIPANT 7They were definitely on board with the CHANGE they have moved from the being

191
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:13.127
PARTICIPANT 7in denial and having the anxiety of CHANGE, and not being familiar with it, not knowing if they're gonna know how to

192
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.109
PARTICIPANT 7worked with salesforce. They had moved into that acceptance phase.

193
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.429
PARTICIPANT 7And

194
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:30.299
PARTICIPANT 7they could see, okay, this is working so much better. It's making our work life so much easier. So they definitely were receptive to it.

195
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:41.939
PARTICIPANT 7and in reference to REVENUEI do believe that it increased the revenue. It made an easier transition for us to market to our customers

196
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.680
PARTICIPANT 7and share with them. You know how we're

197
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:56.059
PARTICIPANT 7being, how we care and extending that empathy to them. And then they're getting all of these EMAILS automatically, you know. So it it

198
00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:20.020
PARTICIPANT 7it makes it look like we really care which companies do care. That's whole PURPOSE of being in the healthcare industry. But we want to make sure that the customers feel like that. They are that we're listening to them and hearing what they have to say in the CHANGES. So I definitely think it INCREASED REVENUEbecause we were able to win over more customers as well.

199
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.289
Unice Harris: Okay, that makes perfect sense.

200
00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:34.109
Unice Harris: Question number 6, can you share an example of a DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION that went very well? Also, one that didn't go so very well. And what did you do differently between the 2.

201
00:28:36.496 --> 00:28:45.060
PARTICIPANT 7Okay? So I think Salesforce went very well for me. I think that was a win definitely a win win, because again.

202
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:56.109
PARTICIPANT 7They had tried to implement it for 4 to 5 years. I was able to implement it in less than a year, and was up and ready for open season, so that went really well.

203
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:06.840
PARTICIPANT 7One that didn't go so well is with another company that I was with, and we were implementing a financial package.

204
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:13.070
PARTICIPANT 7and there was a glitch in the SYSTEM. For instance.

205
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.630
PARTICIPANT 7the Federal Reserve.

206
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.980
PARTICIPANT 7as

207
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.180
PARTICIPANT 7when PEOPLE write a check or

208
00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:36.370
PARTICIPANT 7well, yeah, it's basically when they write a check, the Federal Reserve has to clear within, like they have 60 s to clear whether the check is gonna be there. And there was a glitch in the SYSTEM that no one

209
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.740
PARTICIPANT 7capture

210
00:29:38.258 --> 00:29:44.690
PARTICIPANT 7and depending on who you're asking and how they're calculating. It was a 50 billion dollar glitch

211
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.719
PARTICIPANT 7Which caught the attention of

212
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.600
PARTICIPANT 7the chairman.

213
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:58.449
PARTICIPANT 7and that if something like that was to happen again, that a lot of PEOPLE would have lost their jobs.

214
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:07.749
PARTICIPANT 7So that was the time where it just didn't go well at all. And actually I was brought in to make sure that that didn't happen again and

215
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.840
PARTICIPANT 7implemented. A mitigation plan to actually

216
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.150
PARTICIPANT 7prevent that from happening again with the Qa

217
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.319
PARTICIPANT 7SYSTEM with the way that they would Qa or test

218
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.320
PARTICIPANT 7before going into production.

219
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.540
PARTICIPANT 7Okay.

220
00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:30.251
Unice Harris: With that 50 billion dollars. That's a lot of money.

221
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.420
PARTICIPANT 7Afternoon.

222
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:39.480
Unice Harris: When you went in after that issue, were they more receptive to CHANGE or more hesitant to CHANGE.

223
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:48.999
PARTICIPANT 7Very receptive. There were a lot of jobs on the line. PEOPLE's livelihoods were on the line, so they were eager to make that CHANGE and

224
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.800
PARTICIPANT 7put in gate stops to make sure it didn't happen again.

225
00:30:54.090 --> 00:31:06.220
Unice Harris: Okay, okay, question number 7, can you share any activity that you've taken to create a more DIGITAL innovation mindset within the ORGANIZATION.

226
00:31:08.919 --> 00:31:15.310
PARTICIPANT 7Yes. So I think again that part goes back to

227
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:27.550
PARTICIPANT 7kind of recently, when I first took on. So I work with salesforce at my previous job. And now salesforce is my customer at my current position.

228
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:34.224
PARTICIPANT 7and you can imagine it's constant CHANGE, because

229
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:52.502
PARTICIPANT 7it's basically a marketing company. All the EMAILS we get about, you know, sales and things that's all salesforce. So all the PEOPLE don't like to use the word spam. But all the spam that we get that's salesforce. So

230
00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:01.979
PARTICIPANT 7for me, going in holding everyone accountable. And you know, putting in stops and

231
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:20.099
PARTICIPANT 7agree into things upfront with the customer. You know. How do we want these things to work, I think, is good. Originally they were resistant CHANGE. Some of the CHANGES to that. I wanted to put in place but as their customer SUCCESS account manager.

232
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:44.719
PARTICIPANT 7and the recommendations that I was making, I think they became very receptive to, because it holds everyone accountable. So I think that made a huge difference in how we approach the issues that we were facing in reference to the applications that they have in place, and all the tools and subscriptions that they're using.

233
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.740
Unice Harris: Okay.

234
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.339
Unice Harris: that's good. You have some very interesting experiences.

235
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.130
Unice Harris: Question number 8 after the rollout into production.

236
00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:09.240
Unice Harris: How did the TRANSFORMATION give you or the employees and STAKEHOLDERS the results that they were expecting for your salesforce implementation for the

237
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:24.749
Unice Harris: banking implementation that we had to come in. They've been trying to implement this thing for 5 years, and then, with your banking situation, they've lost billions of dollars after you went in and rolled it out into production?

238
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.320
Unice Harris: Did it give them what they wanted?

239
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:34.360
PARTICIPANT 7Absolutely in both cases. So I'll start with the Federal Reserve.

240
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:40.720
PARTICIPANT 7it actually gave them the results. They wanted one. It wasn't clear

241
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:48.770
PARTICIPANT 7who the third party vendor or the in-house Qa. TEAM, who was TESTING what?

242
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.859
PARTICIPANT 7Who was

243
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:56.950
PARTICIPANT 7even coding for in reference to the development TEAM. The requirements were not clear. So.

244
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.640
PARTICIPANT 7after going in and

245
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.740
PARTICIPANT 7getting clarity on all these things in the implementation.

246
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.680
PARTICIPANT 7we were able to

247
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:12.662
PARTICIPANT 7see the difference. We seen the difference in how things were working.

248
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.440
PARTICIPANT 7so after that I feel like

249
00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.650
PARTICIPANT 7there was

250
00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:42.909
PARTICIPANT 7no loss of revenue. So of course, the REVENUEincreased, the profit increased. With the Federal Reserve, so that definitely, I would definitely say that was good there, good progression, and likewise with salesforce. And that's still in progress. We just implemented some additional subscriptions. Mark subscriptions.

251
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.879
PARTICIPANT 7So it's definitely working for them. Their whole PROCESS is that it's just on a upwards trajectory. So

252
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.889
PARTICIPANT 7I've really had SUCCESS with this customer.

253
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.320
Unice Harris: Okay, good, awesome.

254
00:34:57.933 --> 00:35:00.799
Unice Harris: When I say CHANGE MAANAGEMENT.

255
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:12.242
Unice Harris: I'm referring to everything that we just talked about, you know, letting them know. Letting the entire ORGANIZATION know early. Like what you did.

256
00:35:13.156 --> 00:35:33.230
Unice Harris: talking to the STAKEHOLDERS. Conducting the TRAINING, conducting the TESTING, conducting the post rollout COMMUNICATION sharing. That's what we refer to by CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. So with that being said, can you share? Why, you think that CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is important or not important.

257
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:46.759
PARTICIPANT 7I feel like it's important cause, you're actually managing the ORGANIZATIONal overall TRANSFORMATION, with the in the form of PEOPLE, their PROCESSES

258
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:54.510
PARTICIPANT 7required enable measurables. You know. How are you measuring this significant CHANGE?

259
00:35:55.274 --> 00:36:12.229
PARTICIPANT 7PEOPLE are reluctant to but what is it that? What's your goal? And how are you defining SUCCESS? So, knowing all those things upfront and checking those boxes out is how I feel like

260
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:24.009
PARTICIPANT 7we manage that CHANGE. And then it's all in the mindset of the individual. So CHANGE MAANAGEMENT to me is changing the mind of the PEOPLE.

261
00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:38.770
PARTICIPANT 7So, and it's a PROCESS and getting PEOPLE to CHANGE their mind, because for one, they're stuck in the way that they know things, they're stuck there. So the previous position that I held

262
00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:45.249
PARTICIPANT 7my recommendation was that we implement a CHANGE MAANAGEMENT TEAM.

263
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:52.109
PARTICIPANT 7Because we need the CHANGE MAANAGEMENT TEAM to go and socialize.

264
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.000
PARTICIPANT 7What CHANGE is

265
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.219
PARTICIPANT 7the PROCESS of the CHANGE.

266
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:56.680
Unice Harris: Right.

267
00:36:57.079 --> 00:37:02.270
PARTICIPANT 7To get PEOPLE on board. So that's how I feel like

268
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.379
PARTICIPANT 7we were able. I've been able to get the significant CHANGE that we need

269
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.940
PARTICIPANT 7for PEOPLE to BUYINto the program.

270
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:17.640
PARTICIPANT 7And I think I answered your question, but if not, tell me what else you need on that one.

271
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:35.690
Unice Harris: I think you've answered that. That I appreciate. You know you're taking the time to be a part of this session and like, I said, I kNEW that you had a wealth of experience. Because you've been

272
00:37:36.107 --> 00:37:54.459
Unice Harris: in the space for a long time. And it's just again an honor to have you offer your feedback into the study. There's a lot going on within this TRANSFORMATION space. And you know, we see we're seeing that

273
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.270
Unice Harris: you know, 70%

274
00:37:57.876 --> 00:38:05.029
Unice Harris: or more of the TRANSFORMATIONs are failing. And you know, one of the things that we're seeing is that

275
00:38:05.596 --> 00:38:12.679
Unice Harris: hesitance to CHANGE is a lot, a big part of that you know.

276
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.540
Unice Harris: percentage.

277
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:37.379
Unice Harris: So how to do everything in this study to identify the BENEFITS of incorporating CHANGE MAANAGEMENT into the study so that you don't just roll out the TECHNOLOGY and then have the end user. Say, what is this doing? What what am I supposed to do with this? And then you have the end? Customers and end users impacted by

278
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:44.640
Unice Harris: the negative aspects of it. So thank you so much for participating. Let me get

279
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:49.720
Unice Harris: stop the recording, and then we can kind of talk a little bit more about things. Hold on.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:58.595
Unice Harris: and I'm also excited to see the young PEOPLE like yourself getting prepared to take over this industry when the older ones of us get ready to retire. I think you're. You've been a certified scrum, master since you were 21 years old, and you're getting ready to graduate from college this year, and that's just very, very exciting to see.

8
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.590
Unice Harris: I look forward to hearing you answer the questions. You have a wealth of experience behind you already, and I'm just

9
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.949
Unice Harris: I just wanna thank you again for agreeing to participate in the study.

10
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.890
PARTICIPANT 8 Yes, ma'am, of course the pleasure is all mine. Thank you for inviting me to

11
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.780
PARTICIPANT 8 participate in this study with you. You know. Obviously, I know your background. You know you've been doing this for

12
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.279
PARTICIPANT 8 for a very long time. And you know you being one of the top professors in this field is just. It means everything for me, as a young, you know, up, up and coming.

13
00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:38.600
PARTICIPANT 8 You know. Yeah, up and coming guide just be able to learn more from you and kind of just learn from

14
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.339
PARTICIPANT 8 your wealth of experience. And then, hopefully, I can take something from this session, and use it to better myself in the future.

15
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.623
Unice Harris: Wonderful. So with that being said, I will just go ahead and get started.

16
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.779
Unice Harris: Just answer the questions. As you've

17
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:25.089
Unice Harris: feel as you deem appropriate. There's no right or wrong answer. Just pull from your experiences. Whether it be DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION on the basketball court. DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION and ORGANIZATION. However, you want to. Add or include feel free to just express your experiences. So question number one

18
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.080
Unice Harris: during the initiation or other phase, or just the start of a PROJECT?

19
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.075
Unice Harris: Can you share a time when you communicated the PURPOSE of the TRANSFORMATION PROJECT to the ORGANIZATION and

20
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.890
Unice Harris: just how it would enhance or help.

21
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.570
PARTICIPANT 8 You

22
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.250
PARTICIPANT 8 absolutely. So

23
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.423
PARTICIPANT 8 Few years ago we actually took a high school

24
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:57.620
PARTICIPANT 8 a high school basketball TEAM. We gifted them. Our. our initial SYSTEM shot tracker. Shot tracker at first was.

25
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:10.080
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, I mean, we we were kind of just now getting our name out there. We had kind of been developing the PROJECT in secret for like quite some time, you know, the guys, Bruce Ianni and David on Ross began to kind of

26
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.050
PARTICIPANT 8 took me under their wing

27
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:19.919
PARTICIPANT 8 when I was younger, and just kinda showed me the ropes in the business and kinda helped me. You know, I learned so much things about just developing and

28
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.089
PARTICIPANT 8 everything like that. But that's beside the point. Honestly.

29
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.540
PARTICIPANT 8 what we did was our pitch was basically, Hey, you know we can help you guys make your lives easier.

30
00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:38.555
PARTICIPANT 8 Everybody knows basketball. You have to keep stats. You have to keep track. You had to pay PEOPLE to do those things. Not every high school can afford that.

31
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.010
PARTICIPANT 8 So we just we. We installed our SYSTEM in the roof of the gymnasium. We had. Each player have

32
00:04:47.430 --> 00:05:10.750
PARTICIPANT 8 their own personal shot tracker. We call them biscuits. They're like really, really small squares, and they have inside them all the motion sensor motion detective TECHNOLOGY off our patented TECHNOLOGY. And at first the guys were kind of looking at us kind of like cause they never seen it before. I mean, when you're playing basketball. Typically all you need is a ball, a hoop, and a couple of jerseys. But

33
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.019
PARTICIPANT 8 you know for us we had to explain to them, hey, this can keep your stats in real time.

34
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.409
PARTICIPANT 8 you know. So this is literally a SYSTEM that can

35
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.040
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, as you snap your finger

36
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.830
PARTICIPANT 8 and let the ball go

37
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:36.552
PARTICIPANT 8 from. When it goes through the net it can keep track of your makes misses. How many assist you have, etc. So once we kind of told them that we kind of gave them a run through, let them test it out, showed them some live footage of

38
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.919
PARTICIPANT 8 the app actually tracks the live movements of the game.

39
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:50.869
PARTICIPANT 8 It was, you know, the guys are pretty. So thought it was pretty cool. So we just had to kind of explain it to them a little bit and get them to wrap their mind around what exactly it was and where the BENEFIT was, gonna be for them.

40
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.080
Unice Harris: Wonderful. Thank you for sharing that. That's a good. That's a good analogy.

41
00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:08.489
Unice Harris: Because you you talk to them about the BENEFITS of having that. And boy, that's innovation on 10. That. That's amazing.

42
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:30.144
Unice Harris: So question number 2, during the requirements or other phase of the TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you informed cross functional TEAMS as a whole of how the TRANSFORMATION would impact them specifically, and how it would affect or impact or enhance how they do their work, and I think you already answered that

43
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.929
PARTICIPANT 8 Well, yeah, but I can elaborate on that. If you would like me to.

44
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.000
Unice Harris: Yes, please.

45
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:43.500
PARTICIPANT 8 Well, I mean, so, okay, basically. So shot tracker in this. How I explain to them, shot tracker is a 2 piece bluetooth, low energy. Wearable device.

46
00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:47.990
PARTICIPANT 8 It tracks the motion of the basketball players risk and the impact of the ball in the net.

47
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:57.629
PARTICIPANT 8 The wrist biscuit is inside of a sweat bend or spandex sleeve. You can put it inside your sock. It just it's it just depends on the person you can put it anywhere

48
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.460
PARTICIPANT 8 the other sensor attaches to the net.

49
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.110
PARTICIPANT 8 and it detects when the basketball hits it.

50
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.630
PARTICIPANT 8 Now we also have sensors in the in the ceiling that have cameras.

51
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.570
PARTICIPANT 8 and we did not add those until later, because initially.

52
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.902
PARTICIPANT 8 in our first go around, we had. We had quite a few bugs, quite a few issues with the ball not being able to be tracked.

53
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:40.602
PARTICIPANT 8 sometimes, you know during the practices there might be only 5 or 10 players on the court, but there are players standing around the court as well, so we kinda had to put cameras to get a better map of the court overall, and kinda so, you know, make some boundaries DIGITALly. So the shot tracker device, if a player stepped outside, those boundaries would not count their stats or points, is being invalid. So

54
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.299
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, those are just a few of the hiccups that we ran into, and you know it was pretty.

55
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.410
PARTICIPANT 8 It was pretty open. I mean, we're a small TEAM here.

56
00:07:49.440 --> 00:08:14.979
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, only about 15 PEOPLE, you know, in our building. So the development it guys, those guys are right there. I mean, you know, we're we're literally all working next to. I'm not gonna say work on top of you. So we're working right next. So you know, it's nothing to. There's a basketball court that we usually, you know, the guys usually play a pick up things after lunch or at the end of the day. So we typically get all of our stuff out. After that, you know, play a pick up game, and then

57
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:22.160
PARTICIPANT 8 just kind of sit down to those guys and just openly communicate what needs to be better. And I feel like that's one of the main reasons why

58
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.949
PARTICIPANT 8 we've been able to move into so many different schools.

59
00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:31.469
PARTICIPANT 8 High school, college and professionally is because we just have such a

60
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.650
PARTICIPANT 8 such an open COMMUNICATION around here. You don't have to jump through hoops to get things done.

61
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.985
Unice Harris: Right. Thank you for that.

62
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:54.320
Unice Harris: Has there ever been a time where you didn't inform them of the same where you just rolled out a PROJECT. Didn't tell anybody didn't inform them of the BENEFITS, or

63
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.350
Unice Harris: and there doesn't have to be. But has there ever been a time.

64
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.720
PARTICIPANT 8 I can't say I mean, and and it

65
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.386
PARTICIPANT 8 our pitch has definitely CHANGEd over the years.

66
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:24.070
PARTICIPANT 8 but I feel like that's just normal evolution of the company we've never really had. I'm sorry I can't really provide an example. We've never really had a time where we just rolled it out on someone I mean, you know, genuinely, genuinely, PEOPLE want to know.

67
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.830
PARTICIPANT 8 kind of like what they're getting into, because it costs for us to set this up additionally to like.

68
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.859
PARTICIPANT 8 because this type of product we have, they're really, you know, you kind of don't just roll it out.

69
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:42.829
PARTICIPANT 8 You kind of have to explain. You know what's going on, what what the basis of everything is, and then you kind of have to see, you know, get PEOPLE to

70
00:09:42.850 --> 00:10:06.060
PARTICIPANT 8 understand how it BENEFITS them cause at first, you know, you tell someone you wanna come in install cameras and install sensors. They don't really understand why they've ever seen that before, and then we pull up Nba footage and footers of Olympian guys TRAINING in our facilities. And you know, just showing that we're trusted, you know, worldwide among the elite, the most elite athletes in the world. And then PEOPLE kind of start to see the vision.

71
00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:13.489
PARTICIPANT 8 I will say this when we did roll it out the first time in our first school we did it for free.

72
00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:32.830
PARTICIPANT 8 so that that that would be an explanation kind of a example of maybe a time. We didn't really reveal as much INFORMATION, but that was more so because we were still in our early phase. We wanted to see what worked and what didn't work. So we we yeah. So we didn't really have as many details to guarantee. Or.

73
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.830
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, we just kind of had to

74
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.859
PARTICIPANT 8 roll the ball and go.

75
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:54.319
Unice Harris: Okay. Question number 3, and thank you for clarifying that in the design phase, or any other phase before development of the TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you provide a TRAINING relative to the NEW PROCESS TECHNOLOGY or the initiative.

76
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.786
PARTICIPANT 8 Well,

77
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.969
PARTICIPANT 8 that's a good question.

78
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.560
PARTICIPANT 8 Provided TRAINING

79
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.096
PARTICIPANT 8 for me, you know, being an athlete myself.

80
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.950
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, during that time

81
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:26.729
PARTICIPANT 8 a lot of times. I will be the one when we went to schools to demonstrate the the shot track. We would just take the 2 piece Kit which you which is also available for purchase. Anyone can use that. It does not matter if you have, you know, driveway basketball. Anyone can use that. But we would just, you know, I would just put the little

82
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:34.980
PARTICIPANT 8 the sleeve on, and we would use a ladder and connect the sentence to the net, and I would just show kids in real time. I always just I let them watch me.

83
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:43.740
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, go through a shooting workout, or if the TEAM had a player that was really interested in basketball and plan. You know, the next level. I would take him through a shooting workout.

84
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:59.199
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, and just kinda let him see, you know. Hey, man, you know you can use the gun, you know. Dr. Dish, those are really popular alternatives. But, man, this right here lets you do anything anywhere, anytime. It's portable, and you can keep your stats on on your phone.

85
00:12:00.338 --> 00:12:05.140
PARTICIPANT 8 And I just think that when they see it, you know they can hear about it. But when they see it.

86
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:16.259
PARTICIPANT 8 and they and they see how it works. And they see how much better it's gonna get them, how easy it's gonna be to to to shoot and get your percentages without having to keep track of the score in your head. I mean, we all forget

87
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:22.439
PARTICIPANT 8 how many jumpers we make after a certain time, especially when you're like me. You're shooting 5 or 600 of them in a session.

88
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:29.710
PARTICIPANT 8 you know. This is like for high volume trainers. And when we, when PEOPLE see that they wanna be associated with other high volume workers like.

89
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:39.380
PARTICIPANT 8 you know. At least she was like Ray out, and Stephan Curry, Kaiya, and PEOPLE who use this SYSTEM, you know, and it kind of just it sells itself. Really, you know, the the the TRAINING

90
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.940
PARTICIPANT 8 sells itself.

91
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.349
Unice Harris: Or may.

92
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.130
PARTICIPANT 8 So.

93
00:12:42.530 --> 00:13:04.759
Unice Harris: That's an amazing product. And you are very lucky to have had the opportunity to participate in it. On the ground level when they were just rolling it out. You mentioned that the first few were rolled out for free. And you mentioned that you guys put them through TRAINING, and so on and so forth, did the PROJECT eventually increase revenue.

94
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:25.880
PARTICIPANT 8 Absolutely, I mean, and it. And it took it took a while. I mean, I'm not. Gonna I'm not gonna act like it was just right away. We had a lot of issues. At first we had a lot of issues. We had to iron out we went a lot of different ways about it, you know. For a while we had a shot tracker, basketball. Actually, it was our own. It was a sporting. Tf, 1, 50.

95
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.809
PARTICIPANT 8 Which is the official ball for the High School level, and I believe, for the Nai level.

96
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.330
PARTICIPANT 8 we actually

97
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.580
PARTICIPANT 8 but patent

98
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.610
PARTICIPANT 8 to get a modified version

99
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:58.450
PARTICIPANT 8 of that ball made in our factory where we get the same materials. But we would put the shot tracker TECHNOLOGY inside of a ball. And this is. And we did this in an effort to make it easier for shot tracker to be used on a cord in a real game. In real time the ball moves and it can track DIGITALly

100
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.850
PARTICIPANT 8 in real time where the ball is moving

101
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.849
PARTICIPANT 8 from player to player, from player to hoop. So.

102
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.469
PARTICIPANT 8 though those were one of the innovations that we kind of had to

103
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:27.150
PARTICIPANT 8 that we came across during the PROCESS. And I feel like when we kind of mastered that. And we got multiple patents and multiple companies were allowing us to use their basketballs like Spalding, Wilson, Rawlings, and we were able to reach multiple markets. Nikey was another notable net. Not notable member.

104
00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:45.830
PARTICIPANT 8 Once we got that REVENUEstarted to pick up, because now you've got more schools interested, whereas before. We didn't have the Nike pad. So Nike schools they use Nike basketballs. They wear Nike shoes. They wear everything Nike, everything's Nike. They they wouldn't. They weren't interested because we we couldn't. We couldn't put the TECHNOLOGY in the basketballs.

105
00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:59.789
PARTICIPANT 8 Once we got that that opened up a door to a plethora of other. You know, high level division, one of the schools, and even elite level high schools that are that are sponsored by these these big shoe companies.

106
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.411
Unice Harris: Thank you for sharing that

107
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.519
Unice Harris: in the TESTING phase

108
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:17.584
Unice Harris: of a TRANSFORMATION. Can you share how you tested the NEW TECHNOLOGY or the PROCESS, and I think you talked about that a little bit, too. But can you elaborate a little bit on how you tested it before.

109
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.770
PARTICIPANT 8 Senior.

110
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.580
PARTICIPANT 8 Oh, I'm sorry, doctor. I'm sorry.

111
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.299
Unice Harris: Oh, no! No! Go ahead!

112
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.834
PARTICIPANT 8 Okay, yeah, absolutely.

113
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.817
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, TESTING phase,

114
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.389
PARTICIPANT 8 and I mean, you're right. I kind of already touched on it. It

115
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.160
PARTICIPANT 8 realistically. We just used to hoop.

116
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:46.799
PARTICIPANT 8 If I'm being completely honest with you, we would just get out there like I said, we have a really small TEAM. We have about 15 PEOPLE at the time. We had about 10 to 15 PEOPLE.

117
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.989
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, and and and and early on, it was really closer to around 7 or 8,

118
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.879
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, so we would just get out there, man, like we have a basketball court right in the back of the facility.

119
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:16.219
PARTICIPANT 8 And man it was. It was literally, you know, tech fresh out of the box. We get our shipment in. And they man, we were kinda just we were on the court, you know, right away we were on the court the next day or that day TESTING the product. You know, you got guys shorts, Participant 8 tops, you know 10 shoes walking around the office

120
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:40.039
PARTICIPANT 8 because this is really what we do. I mean, we weren't just playing ball. We were really, we're really having to test we, and we have to play in order to. In order to thoroughly test the product we have to play and thoroughly test with players of that caliber. So we would have pros come in and work out for us. We would have professionals come in and play, pick up games. We had high school guys, elite level guys come in and do workouts and play games with this.

121
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.140
PARTICIPANT 8 You know, kind of just to get a feel. You know, we wanted to get

122
00:16:43.500 --> 00:17:07.029
PARTICIPANT 8 a couple of Nba guys opinions on how the basketball, you know, cause these are the guys that have to play with these balls. You know, we're we're designing them. These guys gotta go out there when they're sweaty when they're tired, you know, and they have to perform with these basketballs. And honestly, you know if you're a hooper. Every Hooper knows man. A basketball, a good basketball makes a difference, you know it really does is like a good pair of shoes.

123
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:17.060
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, it's gonna make all the difference and how your game is played so that we can get these basketballs as close to possible as what they really like with our TECHNOLOGY in them.

124
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:34.120
PARTICIPANT 8 You know that that that would be that would be beneficial. But yeah, just to keep it short, the only way we really test was just by action. We just had to get out there and try. And then, if it didn't work, we just had to try something else. Go back to the drawing board, but we just had to get out there and and and try. You know

125
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.420
PARTICIPANT 8 ourselves.

126
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.080
Unice Harris: Thank you for sharing that

127
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.638
Unice Harris: question. Number 5, after you rolled it out into production?

128
00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:44.570
Unice Harris: How were

129
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:51.719
Unice Harris: the users allowed to offer feedback relative to what worked and what did not work.

130
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.138
PARTICIPANT 8 Okay. So so

131
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.559
PARTICIPANT 8 that's a really good question.

132
00:17:57.985 --> 00:18:05.689
PARTICIPANT 8 You know the owners, Bruce Bruce Ianni, man, he he was really influential in this. He was really, really

133
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:12.620
PARTICIPANT 8 a fan of constructive criticism. You don't see that too often, you know. Normally, the boss doesn't want to be told.

134
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.690
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, kind of like what's going on. They don't really want to be. They don't really want to be back a any any backtop.

135
00:18:19.202 --> 00:18:26.230
PARTICIPANT 8 That's how I would say it. They're kind of like man, you know. This is my deal. I've already done the thinking for you. I don't need you to think. Just do it

136
00:18:26.921 --> 00:18:40.280
PARTICIPANT 8 and then I feel like that's like, was progress. A lot of times he was the complete opposite. He was looking for feedback anywhere he could find me, and you know that includes us coaches, players, you know. He would stop by monthly.

137
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:58.660
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, sometimes weekly in the beginning, just to kind of check out practice. He might come at the end of practice to ask the guys, man, how'd that ball feel, you know? Can you see yourself playing with it? Is it bounce free? Is it shooting? Funny, you know. Are? Are the sensors working you are? Are you? Are you having a heart? Is it? Is it weighing you down?

138
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:07.750
PARTICIPANT 8 Do we need to get a lighter chip, you know? Do we need to look at some wristband? Shoot a sleeve? I mean, it was just, you know, just constant questions and feedback. And then.

139
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:13.700
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, he was always, you know, he gave us, you know, gave all the guys his phone number. Personal phone number.

140
00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:25.290
PARTICIPANT 8 You know. Call him anytime. Send him the text anytime. If he doesn't answer. And you know, just let him know. Hey, this is something I think you guys can do better. And we took those suggestions and we ran with it

141
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.489
PARTICIPANT 8 additionally, additionally, yeah.

142
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.839
PARTICIPANT 8 Being such open COMMUNICATION in the office.

143
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.339
PARTICIPANT 8 you know you can walk into this office. And hey, Bruce, man, I have thought I have an idea.

144
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:52.449
PARTICIPANT 8 you know. Hey, boost, man, I was. I was playing the other day, and this happened. You know the whole. The whole thing is, he wants PEOPLE who are gonna use the software so they can test it. He doesn't want to get the software and just sit on it. He wants PEOPLE, his employees perfectly to be active

145
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:58.129
PARTICIPANT 8 users of the product. So I use the product daily, and I let him know feedback daily.

146
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.190
PARTICIPANT 8 So.

147
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.670
Unice Harris: Good. Okay, thank you for that. Thank you for sharing that. That's amazing.

148
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:33.630
Unice Harris: question. Number 6, and you may not have any PROJECTs that went poorly. But can you share an example of a TRANSFORMATION that went very well also one that didn't go very well. And what did you do differently between the 2, and I think you shared about the shot tracker. That seemed to have gone very well. Is there anything that, or any one PROJECT that didn't go very well. And again you don't.

149
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.250
PARTICIPANT 8 I don't have.

150
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.020
Unice Harris: At all.

151
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.190
PARTICIPANT 8 No, absolutely

152
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:48.499
PARTICIPANT 8 I really there. There's several situations where I could name that they did not go. Well, I don't really know if I'm authorized to speak

153
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:58.549
PARTICIPANT 8 on those situations because they are confidential. And there's a whole lot of paperwork and agreements, and especially when you get to the High level division one schools.

154
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:06.659
PARTICIPANT 8 There's a lot of you know. I wanna want to say secrecy, but there's just confidentiality there. So I don't really want to touch on that. But I can give you this

155
00:21:07.074 --> 00:21:08.570
PARTICIPANT 8 A few years ago

156
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.369
PARTICIPANT 8 our company EMAIL service provider, we actually switched

157
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:24.620
PARTICIPANT 8 from the old Gmail service provider to the NEW, the outlook like Microsoft Outlook. And then that was hard. That was difficult, and that wasn't really due

158
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.979
PARTICIPANT 8 necessarily to our own circumstances. We really weren't

159
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:36.109
PARTICIPANT 8 the cause of that. We really didn't have as much control over it, but it was just hard. It was just kind of a hard merger.

160
00:21:36.494 --> 00:21:39.619
PARTICIPANT 8 you know. I mean, we we lost a lot of INFORMATION.

161
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.370
PARTICIPANT 8 Data

162
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.529
PARTICIPANT 8 was backed up.

163
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.920
PARTICIPANT 8 We got locked. I mean, it was just. There were bugs and glitches all over left and right.

164
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:54.000
PARTICIPANT 8 Inboxes weren't properly filtering out spam. So a lot of times.

165
00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.199
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, our our owners. They couldn't even really check the EMAIL because they were getting overloaded with spam.

166
00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:04.610
PARTICIPANT 8 You know, it was. It was a lot of different things I could touch base on, but

167
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.831
PARTICIPANT 8 I would just wanna use that

168
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.150
PARTICIPANT 8 as a and I was. I wasn't really hands on with that Mert, with that

169
00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:21.591
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, with that TRANSFORMATION. But I can't really speak on anything else that I was handling with the company. I'm sorry I just don't.

170
00:22:22.235 --> 00:22:23.270
Unice Harris: No! You're fine!

171
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.770
PARTICIPANT 8 That level of clearance.

172
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:32.920
Unice Harris: Yep, you're absolutely fine. We'll skip right over that, because I don't want you to share anything that you can or should be sharing.

173
00:22:33.597 --> 00:22:44.764
Unice Harris: Question number 7, is there any activity that you took to help create? A DIGITAL innovation mindset within the ORGANIZATION?

174
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.560
PARTICIPANT 8 Caves.

175
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.702
Unice Harris: You know you talked about the basketball? Was it difficult for

176
00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:59.250
Unice Harris: Was it difficult for players to catch on to that NEW innovation, or did they pick that up right away.

177
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.559
PARTICIPANT 8 I mean, really.

178
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:13.124
PARTICIPANT 8 we just okay. Honestly, a shot tracker. We aim to improve the performance of competitive athletes who participate in TEAM sports at all levels while bringing elite level analytics to the masses.

179
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.819
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, we see the game a little bit differently. We don't just see it for what it is, but also for what it can be.

180
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.460
PARTICIPANT 8 And

181
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.450
PARTICIPANT 8 I mean, we just kind of feel like we can turn a cold streak into a hot when we feel like

182
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:39.259
PARTICIPANT 8 we could, we? We could take underperforming TEAMS and turn them into CHAMPIONship TEAMS just by seeing gaps in the game and giving them keys to close those gaps and giving them the power to unleash their game.

183
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.449
PARTICIPANT 8 I feel like when you, when you put it that way.

184
00:23:42.928 --> 00:23:54.920
PARTICIPANT 8 A lot of PEOPLE begin to see the vision and get to see. Hey, this is not just some useless jargon. This actually can help your TEAM win. This actually will help your TEAM win in me in in many ways. I mean.

185
00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:02.847
PARTICIPANT 8 like I said, those Nba guys, they get real elite level analytics. They get shot percentages.

186
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:12.700
PARTICIPANT 8 they figure out where you know, like Star Trek, or similar to them, can show you where you're hot. You know your hotspots are. Where are you shooting cold, and where are you shooting hot?

187
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.874
PARTICIPANT 8 You know where? What? What places are your

188
00:24:17.106 --> 00:24:36.830
PARTICIPANT 8 you know. Where are your sweet spots on the floor. Where are your weak spots on the floor? Where do you get your most assist? Where do you get your most turnovers like these are advanced stats that you know the I test isn't. Gonna you're not. Gonna remember this, you know, after a whole game, you're gonna have to go back through watch film, take notes and chop this up versus being able to kinda just

189
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.659
PARTICIPANT 8 watch the film and just watch the film to watch the film

190
00:24:40.988 --> 00:24:54.400
PARTICIPANT 8 rather than having to go back through, and then, you know, pause every every 5 s, every 30 s, to take notes of what happened the last 30 s. It just makes coaches lives easier, which entirely is gonna make players lives easier. Because now

191
00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:03.929
PARTICIPANT 8 coaches don't have to go through trial and error. They can just get straight to the point. Hey? We're shooting too low from 3 point line. Let's get the ball inside more or Hey.

192
00:25:04.171 --> 00:25:11.798
PARTICIPANT 8 every time we get to the room below the feet so long we're getting found. Or, Hey, you guys, we're not making our fruit, those TEAM. We're shooting 50%. As a TEAM.

193
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.229
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, we're just trying to bring the elite level analytics. And and then we feel like.

194
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:24.039
PARTICIPANT 8 if we can bring the elite level analytics and make it easier on these guys. Then they it makes it easier for them to get better.

195
00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:31.790
Unice Harris: Awesome. Thank you for sharing that I appreciate that. So after the rollout into production.

196
00:25:33.304 --> 00:25:36.169
Unice Harris: How did the TRANSFORMATION give you

197
00:25:36.818 --> 00:25:41.000
Unice Harris: the results that were expected, I mean, did did the

198
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:51.150
Unice Harris: did the schools, the high schools? Did the colleges? Did you get what you expected? I mean? Was it marketed, you know.

199
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.229
Unice Harris: when they told you how it was supposed to perform? Did it perform that way?

200
00:25:58.489 --> 00:26:02.350
PARTICIPANT 8 Yeah, it it definitely performed that way. I mean.

201
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:16.790
PARTICIPANT 8 it's really just about getting the data and the insights. You need to win more games, you know, with real time, statistical performance data at your fingertips, you have a deeper understanding of how your TEAM is really playing and what's really driving.

202
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:23.400
PARTICIPANT 8 You know, we we're being used currently by Benedicine Air Force case. State is one notable.

203
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.109
PARTICIPANT 8 They just went to the final 4.

204
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.730
Unice Harris: Hmm.

205
00:26:27.138 --> 00:26:28.361
PARTICIPANT 8 This past year.

206
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:37.899
PARTICIPANT 8 they've been a high level elite program. Michigan state with Tom Izzo, Oklahoma University, Virginia. Tech.

207
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:47.589
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, is just these are high level programs. And and I feel like they've all they all feel like as well as we do. Shot tracker has made them better.

208
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:58.469
PARTICIPANT 8 you know as far, especially with college basketball. The way the game is. Now, man, you gotta be able to shoot to 3. There's lights out shooters that are shooting to 3 from way behind 3 point.

209
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.764
PARTICIPANT 8 And

210
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:08.149
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, in a SYSTEM in the area where you have PEOPLE should be, there's a lot of guys who get to college who don't really have their game has developed yet.

211
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:16.359
PARTICIPANT 8 and you know all the coaches say, Hey, man, shot tracker hopes our young guys develop our young guys getting the gym way more than they used to.

212
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:44.139
PARTICIPANT 8 You know he's a coach. This is Tom Isos and John counter parties. Guys who have been doing this for a long time, like guys who have been doing this. You know, Jerome Tangs, Bill selves who have been doing this not only coaching, but coaching at a high, level, legendary names, and they tell us, Hey, man, when you're shot striker got here, man, our young guys getting the gym. We started seeing less of them in parties and campus, and more of them in the gym. And really I really I really genuinely believe that

213
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.880
PARTICIPANT 8 the numbers

214
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:59.920
PARTICIPANT 8 mean a lot. I I genuinely believe that the numbers mean a lot. I think that if you're in your head as a player and you're thinking, hey, man, I'm gonna have to go to the gym man. I know I need to get up these 500 shots. I know I need to really keep track of my shots, but I don't know.

215
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:19.279
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, like shooting a basketball and county 500 shots is is pretty is pretty hard, especially when you have to keep track of how many you made and, miss, you know. So when they can just kind of get in there, just kind of throw on, shoot and sleep, man put it in their sock, or wherever they wanna be put it at, and then

216
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:37.299
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, just kind of play, and just play freely, and then they can look after the workout, and then they can see their numbers and see, okay, hey, man, they're pretty good, or, Hey, my, did pretty bad. That takes you out of that mindset of oh, let me count this. Make. Let me count this, miss, let me just play ball.

217
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:53.540
PARTICIPANT 8 or let me just shoot. And then when I get done, I get to see how good I did. Which is, gonna show me? Okay. So if I'm in this mind state, this is a good mindstay for me to be in in a game versus when you're in it. When you're working out, you don't literally in a game. Count your mason misses.

218
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.190
Unice Harris: Right.

219
00:28:54.590 --> 00:29:09.139
PARTICIPANT 8 You might not even know how many points assist rebounds you had at the end of the game. If you're really in the game playing. So this kind of just helps for those guys get more game, feel game like workouts, which I feel like personally translate better on the port.

220
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:16.269
PARTICIPANT 8 You can work out in practice like you're in a game, and it feels like you're in a game and you get comfortable with that. And you see

221
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:29.240
PARTICIPANT 8 your shots are going in. Then when the game comes, it's gonna be that much easier because you only work out like you're playing in the game you don't have to worry about thinking about makes and misses. I feel like that's a bad way to train

222
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.750
PARTICIPANT 8 play is easy.

223
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:36.989
Unice Harris: Because the tool is is, is, is is calculating your analytics and tracking your analytics for you.

224
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.120
PARTICIPANT 8 Absolutely absolutely. You're not having to think about making the missing. No.

225
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:46.750
Unice Harris: That's amazing. That is amazing. So we've been talking about

226
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:54.849
Unice Harris: CHANGE MAANAGEMENT. Those things that we've been talking about, letting PEOPLE know what the

227
00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:22.306
Unice Harris: what the tool or the TECHNOLOGY is gonna be doing, TRAINING PEOPLE on the NEW TECHNOLOGY or NEW innovation, allowing them to test it and then allowing them to provide a feedback relative to that TRAINING or relative to the the tool, and how they've used it. Can you share? Why, you think that CHANGE MAANAGEMENT of those things are important or not.

228
00:30:23.034 --> 00:30:23.350
PARTICIPANT 8 She.

229
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.169
Unice Harris: Or not important at all.

230
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.219
PARTICIPANT 8 Okay, absolutely. Okay, CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is definitely important.

231
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:36.542
PARTICIPANT 8 Definitely important. And it is a very important because it helps to minimize disruptions to services

232
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.629
PARTICIPANT 8 when you're making CHANGES to critical SYSTEMS like

233
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:46.550
PARTICIPANT 8 it helps, it ties into cost MAANAGEMENT. Excuse me, it reduces risk

234
00:30:47.076 --> 00:30:49.100
PARTICIPANT 8 and it enhances productivity

235
00:30:49.510 --> 00:31:05.379
PARTICIPANT 8 cause I feel like with the clear plan in mind for how the CHANGES will be implemented. You already kind of know that the employees can kind of focus on their work. They don't have to have anxiety about what's gonna come next? Oh, is this gonna get in the way? Is this gonna be is this gonna be

236
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:14.089
PARTICIPANT 8 a roadblock, you know, this month? Or they kinda can just go forth and just be great as employee. They don't have to worry about

237
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.580
PARTICIPANT 8 a whole bunch of nonsense.

238
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:23.100
PARTICIPANT 8 So I feel like CHANGE MAANAGEMENT is very important because it enhances productivity, and it helps to reduce the risk

239
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:23.830
PARTICIPANT 8 of

240
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:30.359
PARTICIPANT 8 You know, the there's there's always potential risks that arise with CHANGES to a product.

241
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:38.439
PARTICIPANT 8 And I feel like I look at it as kind of like a baby. So if you have a baby, and you kind of just let the baby just

242
00:31:38.480 --> 00:32:02.359
PARTICIPANT 8 go on its own like a toddler. I mean, they're gonna hurt themselves. They're NEW to the world. So you kinda have to. You know they they made a CHANGE from being in the womb to being in the world. So now you kinda have to guide them, you have to. You have to leave them alone and hold their hand. It's almost kind of the same with employees except their adults. You don't have to hold their hand, but you have to guide them.

243
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.260
PARTICIPANT 8 You definitely have to give them a heads up

244
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.990
PARTICIPANT 8 on what's coming.

245
00:32:07.424 --> 00:32:19.139
PARTICIPANT 8 CHANGE on them. Yeah, you must. You have to get. And here a shot tracker. We actually are big fans of CHANGE MAANAGEMENT, because we actually CHANGE a lot. We pride ourselves on being like

246
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:32.810
PARTICIPANT 8 like being like water. You know, whatever we're wherever we're needed, we're gonna be. And we're gonna we're gonna fill up form of whatever we're needed by. So whatever schools need, you know, we're always looking to get that TECHNOLOGY and develop it. Or

247
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:47.900
PARTICIPANT 8 we have a better TECHNOLOGY, more efficient TECHNOLOGY comes out than we're trying to CHANGE. We're trying to get our hands on that. And so yeah, CHANGE is a is a thing that we talk about on a daily here on a shot track. We're always bouncing NEW ideas off of each other.

248
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.600
PARTICIPANT 8 And just keeping that honest level and honest form of COMMUNICATION.

249
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:58.756
Unice Harris: I like the analogy that you use and that's a great analogy like

250
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:11.040
Unice Harris: being a baby and moving like a toddler, and needing the guidance because a lot of times what we're trying to do in CHANGE is find a way

251
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:27.940
Unice Harris: to lead PEOPLE through CHANGE without trauma. It's hard to CHANGE how you've been doing things for 10 or 15 years. So you have to build in those CHANGES like you said, to guide them through without them getting hurt.

252
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.440
PARTICIPANT 8 Absolutely, absolutely.

253
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.670
Unice Harris: So warm.

254
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:36.340
PARTICIPANT 8 I love the way you put that. Yeah, making CHANGES without trauma. Absolutely.

255
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:41.820
PARTICIPANT 8 You know, it's not always needed, for you don't always have to put your hand on the fire.

256
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.769
PARTICIPANT 8 you know, to to to know that that fire burns. Sometimes someone can tell you, hey? That's gonna burn.

257
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:54.569
PARTICIPANT 8 And so you don't have to put your hand on the stove in order to find out. I I agree with that. Yeah, that that's that's basically the premise here.

258
00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.110
Unice Harris: Absolutely. Do you want to add anything to?

259
00:34:00.516 --> 00:34:12.190
Unice Harris: This this discussion? Any questions you have for me? Thank you so very much for taking the time to, you know. Answer the questions. I. You gave some great

260
00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:22.480
Unice Harris: analogies, and some great INFORMATION about NEW TECHNOLOGY. And I think that you made my point very clearly, because

261
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:32.960
Unice Harris: a lot of times we think that DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION and NEW innovation is just in one segment. But in this

262
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:42.620
Unice Harris: MEETING. You've proven that innovation and NEW TECHNOLOGY crosses every kind of business sector. It's in healthcare.

263
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.819
Unice Harris: It's an IT,

264
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:55.290
Unice Harris: it's in retail. It's everywhere. And it's in basketball as well as you've ever as you've shown here today. So

265
00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:18.080
Unice Harris: again, we wanna thank you so much for participating in the study and I can't wait to go back and analyze and listen to this. A little more thoroughly. If you want a copy of the end result of the study. Don't hesitate to EMAIL me at you, Harris. 3 Acapella

266
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:23.973
Unice Harris: University. Edu. Let me know if you want a copy of it, and then once I

267
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:44.069
Unice Harris: condense these down, I will send you a copy. If I don't hear back from you within 3 days, I'll go ahead and use it. If you want to CHANGE anything. Make any modifications to the study. You know, respond within 3 days, and if you don't, then, we, you know, move on with what we have.
